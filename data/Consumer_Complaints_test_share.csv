Then I called Transunion back and conferenced in XXXX at XXXX. His number is XXXX. XXXX told Transunion they had sent everything in to remove the 30 days late mistake. They even sent me another letter dated XXXX XXXX, that the delinquency should be removed. Transunion told me to file another dispute. That came back denied as well even after I uploaded the letter from XXXX that the delinquency should be removed. 
On XXXX XXXX at XXXX PST I spoke with XXXX person at Transunion that could n't resolve my issue, then I got her supervisor, he could n't resolve it so I was transferred to HIS supervisor XXXX who told me that the last supervisor tried to do a phone verification with XXXX to verify the delinquency was n't valid however XXXX would n't give out any information. I told XXXX I could conference XXXX in right now to verify. He said he did n't have that capability and I should call back tomorrow and ask for "" Special Handling in the XXXX '' who can do phone verifications. 

This is absolutely ridiculous and I have never gone through a phone experience this bad, all while my credit score is inaccurate because of an incorrect delinquency that the creditor is admitting is not accurate. 

Please help me.

I immediately paid the amount of {$3100.00} to Ocwen, and Ocwen accepted the payment. Afew weeks later I called Ocwen to follow up to see if I was contractually caught up as the attorney letter stated, and I was informed that I was past due for {$470.00}.

I was contacted back by XXXX XXXX who informed me that Ocwen had no record of a letter sent to me by their attorney, and that I was still past due for the {$470.00} to bring me contractually current.

At that time she stated that they had recently acquired my new address as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

Continuing on with the discussion and speaking with XXXX XXXX, she then stated that no documentation was sent to my current address and that the communication was only sent to the previous address. I then iterated that their entry on my credit report violated my rights to verify and validate that the account was mine before reporting to the credit bureaus. I then requested to speak with her boss. I was directed to give XXXX XXXX XXXX a call to further discuss. My second communications with Central Credit involves my restating that this said debt had not been communicated verbally or in writing as my right per the FDCRA. They then restated that they had mailed communication to the previous address but had NOT sent written communication to my present address. The entry to my credit report was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I then requested to speak with the supervisor on duty and was connected to XXXX XXXX, who then preceeded to tell me that communication was sent AGAIN to the previous address but not the current. I then stated to XXXX XXXX that my rights as the consumer being charged as being responsible for this had NOT been communicated as per my rights and that they failed to verify and validate said debt before listing the account on my credit report. XXXX XXXX then stated that Central Credit Services will not confirm or deny that they failed to verify or validate the debt prior to listing the account with the credit reporting agencies. I was then direct again to give XXXX XXXX a call. I have not been able to reach XXXX XXXX and have left him a message regarding this unverified debt.

Per the FRCA and FDCPA, debts are to be verified and validated prior to being reported to the credit reporting agencies.

I was transferred to XXXX, who said she was a supervisor. She informed me that it depended on when XXXX did their 'batching. ' I would see my money XXXX hours after the batching.

I went back today, Friday, and asked XXXX to provide my with a phone number for federal where I could ask for regulations about refunds. I might have asked my dog, he would have done better. No response, just another call to Chase. I did n't ask for that, I asked for a federal bureau to complain to. She tried everything, but no luck. I used to work XXXX, it was mandatory to have the state number for people to complain if they were unhappy. I went home a did the search myself, and got it in a minute. It is now three days, no refund, no answer, no resolution. I would like to know why they can withdraw money instantly, but not refund the money the vendor returns to me instantly? 

How long do they have to return this money to my checking account? 
Should n't they be able to provide a complaint line to the consumer? 
If they hold my money do n't they make interest on it and should n't I receive that money? Where did I go wrong in using my VISA card? 
Why did Chase not provide an adequate answer as to when my money would be returned to my checking account, why such secrecy over the answer?

So with that being said My car was charged off and repossessed because of non payment. I wen tot an organization that was willing to pay the amount owed to get my car out of repossession status. The rep I spoke with was fully aware of what we discussed I repeated the terms over and over and she agreed and told if I paid that amount my car would be released to me. So the company called to get the car she had no recollection of what I was talking about so that 's twice in a matter of months either their incompetent or full of scams.

Americollect has reported this medical debt on both my wife 's and my credit report and I have asked them to remove it, as payments are continually being made, and they refused. In addition, they have multiple negative reports on each of our credit reports for the same single debt. I 've asked them to consolidate this to one report on only one of our credit reports for the corrected amount and they 've refused to do that also. We are making payments on this medical debt and anticipate having it paid off prior to the end of this year, but Americollect needs to report only one amount on one individuals credit report, not multiple amounts across each of our credit reports. 

We just want this multitude of unnecessary information removed from our credit report as soon as possible. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

1/11/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I have written to GreenTree Servicing multiple times over the past year and a half requesting them to remove this account from my credit report due to it containing incorrect information, effecting my ability to attain a higher paying job, and effecting my qualification to purchase a home. Each time they have procrastinated, taking months to reply, or retaliated by changing the account to a more negative wording. 

In XXXX XXXX I was offered a job at a major bank, I was offered a position with an annual salary of {$18000.00} more than I currently earned, plus bonuses which could be another {$15.00} to {$20.00} XXXX per year. However, after performing a background check, they discovered that I had an account with GreenTree which was closed with a balance in early XXXX. After calling to determine what the specifics of that account were, they recinded the offer due it being a foreclosure. After I wrote to GreenTree requesting to lessen the negativity of the account on my credit report in hopes of retaining the job, they took three months to come to a determination that they do not remove information from credit reports, and retaliated by updating my credit report with more negative terms. With that change to my credit report the account appears to have been updated more recently, thus my credit score was lowered. 

Account background : Back in XXXX, we tried to work with original lender ( XXXX XXXX ) and GreenTree Servicing to avoid foreclosure. When I lost my job in XXXX XXXX we notified the original lender ( XXXX XXXX ) the first week that we were unable to make the $ 1750 monthly payments on our {$200000.00} mortgage. They were unwilling to work with me on new payment terms or allow a short sale. They threatened foreclosure, and we moved out of the house in XXXX XXXX. The account then went to GreenTree Servicing. We attempted to short sale again, we even had an offer from a buyer to purchase the home, which had been on the market for several months, but GreenTree declined. We also offered the keys/deed in lieu of foreclosure, and were denied after multiple requests. We were never offered any reduced payment terms, or any alternative to foreclosure. The foreclosure was completed in XXXX XXXX. I later found out that they denied short-sale and deed-in-lieu because we no longer lived in the house, which was ironic as we moved out after they notified us they were foreclosing. 

My credit report shows a monthly payment of only {$610.00} for this account. Ironically, if I had been offered those reduced payment terms then I could/would have kept the house, even without finding new employment. That incorrect monthly payment amount makes me look very pathetic, like I abandoned a {$600.00} a month mortgage. I requested GreetTree to fix this incorrect amount. After a few months of waiting, they declined again saying they do not remove information from credit reports. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681, negative accounts are legally reportable for a maximum of 7 years, XXXX XXXX for this account. Now that the maximum time for this negative account to appear on my credit report has been reached, the account terms are listed incorrectly, GreenTreen gave no alternatives to foreclosure, and GreenTree retaliated after my initial request, I demand this account be removed from my credit history in all major credit bureaus. 

As GreenTree is again ignoring my written requests, I am working with the CFPB to get this resolved quickly so I may purchase a home. Removing this account from my credit report does not harm to them, I do not understand why this company continues to act like such a stubborn, stuck up, jerk.

They confirmed they had received the payment. After they hung from the bank the supervisor for Capital One told me she was going to keep the hold on for several more days. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 a payment of {$17.00} was allowed to go thru. This coming after a hold was placed on the {$180.00}. I told the supervisor : # 1. I suspect that there was an attempt to control my spending view slowing the process to return my credit limit to its normal amount. # 2.How is it that they were the complaint party for my bank who was not concerned with the allege fraud. She stated I should not pay my bill as often as I had. I stated I wanted to produce a good pay record to help my credit and I needed my limit restored in order to buy other goods. I informed the supervisor that I take umbrage to how she and the other employees were handling my situation. The situation being that a made up charge of fraud that the bank where i have paid all of my bills concerning capital One all of a sudden became fraudulent. I ridiculous that Capital One would investigate fraud for another institution who have their own security measures in place. This supervisor called my institution and never offered a legitimate reason for calling only saying it was a mistake that had already been resolved. It was so unbecoming of a business such as Capital One. I told her, I was offended by what they were doing that the real reason for all of this was to keep me from paying my bill so rapidly. She stated the hold would be removed but she cautioned me to not pay my bill as often.

10/12/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Don't agree with fees charged,"I attended XXXX College XXXX. I graduated in XXXX and went into forbearance in XXXX. During this time ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX used boiler room tactics to put borrowers into forbearance because they would have otherwise defaulted. Once forbearance ran out and it was time to make full payments, my loan amount had ballooned from $ XXXX to $ XXXX. And overall, from XXXX to XXXX, the amount of private loans that XXXX XXXX put in forbearance doubled to {$2.00} XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), a district judge XXXX gave his preliminary approval to a settlement agreement in a class action suit filed by investors who claimed that XXXX XXXX, the giant student lending company, had violated federal securities laws. The class action suit claimed that in XXXX, as it prepared itself for a lucrative purchase by a consortium of banks and private equity investors, XXXX XXXX lowered its lending standards to bolster its portfolio of high-interest-earning "" subprime '' private student loans. But, when the economy started to crash and default rates spiked, XXXX XXXX attempted to hide the damage by changing its loan forbearance policy to punt defaults into the future. In the proposed settlement, the XXXX parties agreed to the creation of a {$35.00} XXXX pool to "" resolve investor claims. '' That was good news for the investors, and seems like a relatively cheap price for XXXX XXXX to pay to avoid a trial. But the settlement offered nothing to me, the student who was lured into taking out loans to pay for my education. 
I am not looking for loan forgiveness. I am fully prepared to repay my loans, and to date have paid {$64000.00}. My plea is for XXXX XXXX to reverse the exorbitant ballooning I was illegally coerced into accepting in XXXX. 
WITHOUT my consent, or the consent of my Co-Signer, those {$70000.00} student loans have risen to {$140000.00}. If I had been notified by the loan "" experts '' that forbearance should be used as a last resort as my debts could quickly double, I would never have opted for the forbearance. I was XXXX years old with no concept of the time value of money and XXXX XXXX revealed nothing more than, just pay an extra $ XXXXmonth and we will put you in forbearance. 
So again, I am not seeking forgiveness of my student loans, I am seeking to eradicate the unethical gains of the disreputable XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did not consent to doubling my loans, and neither did my co-signers. I should not pay any debt that was ballooned by commissioned reps in an unregulated environment where boiler room tactics were used.

12/8/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"This pertains to file # XXXX where I have proof that BB & T is lying. On my original complain I stated to BB & T had debited out {$100.00} premature from my account. All this started back on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Where i have made a cash deposit if {$100.00} bringing my balance to {$95.00}. Then on XXXX/XXXX/2015 there was a charge of {$28.00}. And here is where the problems starts. BB & T charges me {$36.00} OVER DRAFTED FEE on XXXX/XXXX/2015. The reason is that BB & T has stated that on XXXX/XXXX/2015 there was a withdrawal of {$100.00} Plus {$3.00} fee for using another banks ATM. The problem here is that it was not on XXXX/XXXX/2015 that the Withdraw occurred but on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I have the Bank Statement for BB & T which I printed off their web site. And what BB & T sent to me. As you can see, from the Bank Statement I am providing it shows where the Withdraw of {$100.00} occurred on XXXX/XXXX/2015. But BB & T takes the {$100.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2015 making my account go NEGATIVE. Furthermore, on XXXX/XXXX/2015 I make yet another deposit of {$100.00} again in cash. But because BB & T took out the {$100.00} on the XXXX/XXXX/2015 it has caused nothing but OVER DRAFT FEES which have total now to a {$260.00} ... And BB & T does not want to remove the fees when I have PROOF directly from their website. 

I have attached Both The Bank Statement that BB & T provides their customers and the So call Bank Statement they provided me with their entire letter providing nothing but misleading information plus inaccurate transactions from the bank to cover its shine! 
But as the saying goes : A picture is worth a thousand words! You be the judge of the proof yourself. And again BB & T states the {$100.00} was for XXXX/XXXX/2015 when it clearly states it on the personal bank statement from the bank on line the transaction took place on XXXX/XXXX/2015.

This means Nationstar is trying to foreclose my home. I bought the house in XXXX and paid my mortgage frequently. XXXX XXXX, XXXX they raised my taxes from {$420.00} to {$940.00} that is a raise of {$510.00} per month. This is wrong. My whole taxes for a whole year is {$6100.00}. Dividing that in 12 months is {$510.00} minus what I pay regularly {$420.00} difference is {$87.00}. This means that my escrow from XXXX XXXX, XXXX need to go up with adding the {$87.00}. My regular payment from {$1800.00} when we add the escrow of {$87.00} my new mortgage payment should be {$1900.00}, not {$2300.00}. They are wrong in the amount of {$430.00}. XXXX XXXX, XXXX they took from my XXXX XXXX XXXX account {$1800.00} and statement is attached. XXXX XXXX, XXXX they cashed my XXXX XXXX check in the amount of {$1800.00} check # XXXX, attached is front & back of check. I mailed a check from XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1800.00} dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX and they cashed the check one ( 1 ) day earlier, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, check # XXXX and statement attached. From XXXX XXXX, XXXX till XXXX XXXX, XXXX I paid 3 months mortgage. I was short in escrow for 3 months, in the amount of {$260.00}. XXXX and XXXX they returned my payments. Now I owe payments for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX a total of 4 months. Monthly {$1900.00} X XXXX = {$7700.00} + XXXX the difference = {$8000.00}. To cover all months of their mistake to the end of XXXX is a total amount of {$8000.00}. If Nationstar Bank makes the corrections and email me the correct amount I have no problem to pay my mortgage. And I can forget NationStar 's mistake. Nationstar can give order to XXXX As Trustee or acting as Agent for the Beneficiary ( XXXX XXXX, Assistant Secretary & Vice President ) to stop the foreclosure and to stop harassing my family with the letters and postings. I have spoken to them many, many times from XXXX XXXX to present, I have faxed documents and proofs that they are wrong about 4-5 times and they make only one correction they charged me double payment in XXXX XXXX. And they returned my payment. It took them more than one year to make this correction. I do not like to have the same mistake happen again, because when I spoke to their research Department many many times they say they can not do a lot, I need to speak to the Tax Department, I spoke to Tax Department and explained the same and faxed the proof on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The same day XXXX XXXX, XXXX I faxed the same documents to the research department. I tried to help them so we all could be on the same page so they make the correct corrections because my taxes went up only {$87.00}, and my correct monthly payment ( principal, Interest, taxes ) is total {$1900.00}, not as they say {$2300.00}. So I can continue to pay my mortgage.

1/8/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"We placed our home on the market in XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, a couple who was pre qualified by Chase Mortgage, signed a contract to purchase our home with a closing date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Because the buyers were pre qualified, we began searching for a home and also signed a conitingency contract. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I contacted our real estate agent to follow up with the buyers agent on us closing on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. We were notified that the buyers had a small hiccup on a stypend issue which would be cleared up by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. All parties agreed to sign an amended contract for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I again inquired to make sure we would be closing on the date the contract ended. To my knowledge no other issues were discovered with the buyers financing, so everything should have been ready for the contracted closing date. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, we were Informed that a supervisor from Chase was assisting in the loan and was working to make the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX closing date. Based on the facts there were no other issues with the buyers financing, but a case of someone at Chase not doing their job. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX we were informed the buyers signed their preliminary closing documents and completed a waiver so that they would be able to close on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX,! we were notified by the buyers agent that the waiver was denied and we would again have to sign an amendment to close on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, so the buyers would be in compliance with the TRID laws. The bottom line : Whoever was in charge of this loan is either incompetent or lazy. The only recourse we have as a seller is to punish the buyers, who did nothing wrong, and terminate the contract. There is no punishment for lending institutions for not doing their job. I used a different lender in my home buying process and we were ready to close on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In the meantime, I have exhausted 3 weeks of earned time off for nothing at a cost of about {$5000.00} dollars, and XXXX dollars on a rental truck, because of the late notification. Not to mention the inconvenience of living out of boxes and suitcases expecting to close on a contracted date only to be told on 2 separate occasions we were not closing. This is unacceptable and I would like someone to tell me why Chase is not liable for incurred expenses by both parties.

I am a single mother who is living 138 % below the poverty level. I have had my share of credit problems and have owed more than I make for quite some time. 
I was misled by Rise Credit to believe that they were unlike other predatory loan companies. By the time I understood what I had sighed, I had paid them thousands of dollars in interest. I have recently become temporarily unemployed and called them to ask for help during my time of financial hardship. They refused any solution and my account is headed to collections now. 
In the last sixty days I have paid over XXXX dollars in interest and the total paid is far over the amount I initially borrowed from Rise. The interest is around XXXX percent. This is robbery and all of the necessities I have for myself and my children are suffering because of it. If I were to steal from someone like Rise has stolen from me it would be considered robbery. 
How is it that they can do this? I am asking for help for not only my family, but for all of the families targeted by these predatory loans meant to target those living in poverty and struggling to live paycheck to paycheck. 
Thank you so much for any assistance.

I suffered job loss about a year later and was receiving numerous calls each day late at night from the collection company my account had been sold to. The collection company refused to take any partial payments I was able to make and frequently threatened me with law suits and seizing of property. Once I was able to begin making payments again, I made a payment of approximately {$3600.00} and set up automatic payments thereafter. Automatic payments were taken from my account as agreed upon for nearly two years until my account was bought back by BMO Harris Bank, at which time the automatic payments stopped with no communication or notification to me. It took a couple months for me to track down the correct contact information of the creditor and set up a new automatic payment agreement. For the next couple years thereafter, automatic payments resumed. I called from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to request written documentation of all payments made since BMO Harris bank does not provide any sort of documentation of payments made, digitally or otherwise, and also to inquire about settlement options. My then current account representative, XXXX, was out of the office and not available to take messages for approximately 2-3 months that I know of, so I never received any response- not even from other reps in the office. I was finally able to reach XXXX in XXXX, at which time she argued with me over my right to receive a response regarding my account. I requested the written documentation and also a new account representative. I also inquired about settling my account, but was given no options- only further argument. I never received the documentation of payment history I requested ( it was supposed to be mailed to me ). After speaking with XXXX in XXXX and having a new account representative assigned, XXXX more automatic payment was taken from my account on XX/XX/XXXX, after which my automatic payments stopped coming out of my account again. I contacted my new rep in XXXX to find out why the payments had stopped and again to request the payment documentation that had never been received. She responded that my automatic payments had been stopped because I had inquired about settling my account, although no options were given and no agreement had been made. She assured me that she had resubmitted the request for payment documentation to be mailed to me and set up my automatic payments again. My next automatic payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX, after which they have stopped again! It is now XXXX and I still have not received the twice requested payment documentation, and the bank still is not honoring our automatic payment agreement.

XXXX states that he has his boss also sending emails and that he will let me know the results. I called XXXX back on XXXX/XXXX/2015 to check the status. I receive XXXX 's answering machine. I left a message to have him call me back, he never called back. I called the local branch and asked to speak with XXXX XXXX, I am told by XXXX, an employee of the branch that XXXX XXXX is on vacation until Monday. I left XXXX a message to have him call me on Monday. Today is Monday, no call form XXXX XXXX all day. I called the branch today at XXXX and I am told XXXX XXXX is not in. I called the Wells Fargo customer service line. I am transferred from person, to person having to explain my story over and over. I 'm finally passed to the fraud department and spoke to XXXX. XXXX is unable to help me, but is able to give me back the {$35.00} insufficient funds fee, which I feel was stolen from me anyways. She directs me to the executive line to see if I can further resolve my issues. I call and spoke to XXXX XXXX, XXXX states that he will reach out to XXXX XXXX, district manager, to see if she can help. My confidence level for the follow through is ZERO. 
At this point I am truly embarrassed to be a member of Wells Fargo and I am disgusted that I am being treated this way. If I ran a business like this

1/7/2016,Mortgage,VA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"OCWEN is my current mortgage servicer. My property is XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX. I purchased my home in XXXX and my servicer previously was GMAC before they filed chapter XXXX bankruptcy. I have had ongoing problems for over 3 years now in the handling of my account. Currently, I am being told that I am behind by over a month on my payments. Over the course of my loan I have had my payments misapplied to principle only and various other issues which at times would make my account delinquent. On many occasions I have had to call and apply extra payments to ensure my account was current to avoid being reported as delinquent on my credit report due to these issues. At XXXX point less then a year ago I was even denied a loan point of contact saying I did not have XXXX but I believe that is a part of the XXXX. Their have also been several calls made in which I was told my account was up to date and or caught up over the last 3 years and now I am being told I have not been on time in over 2 years. 
Communication has been poor at best with OCWEN. Miscommunication has been amplified due to my XXXX deployments as I am a service member, making communication challenging. My wife on more then XXXX occasion has told OCWEN and GMAC employees that I have been deployed in effort to make them aware of the SCRA and has been rebuffed. Even now I am provided pay histories and as I look at it it does n't show when my payments were misapplied and then reapplied which possess a major problem in itself. I am being told I began to fall behind when my ESCROW payments increased but the issues predate that action making it seem like all I am being handed is an excuse to get me to pay with no true effort to find the source of the issues. On top of that the increase in ESCROW would not be when it started as it can also be seen that additional payments were being made to my mortgage to cover that increase. 
At this point the negative reporting on my account is potentially impacting my government clearance, which is need for my job. I am also experiencing a negative financial impact, as I can not refinance with negative reporting. We have requested ESCROW statements since XXXX and none have been provided or received and I am aware of the CFBP and XXXX requirements of service. In the end I have received only a partial history again. No real research has gone into the issue either. My account has been mismanaged for many years now and it appears true to the reputation of OCWEN it is continuing. 
I do not want a handout, all I am looking for is that any delinquency that can not be clearly accounted for be credited to my account and the negative reporting to the credit reporting agencies be removed. I also wonder if my payments are behind why I was never offered a modification under the XXXX. I have asked multiple times about the XXXX and have never had a specialist answer my questions. I am always just told "" no '' with no visible effort to verify. It almost seems as if they do not want to offer me anything under the provisions of the XXXX and are stalling until it expires so that they do not have to. I have educated my self on the settlement OCWEN has just had with the state of New York and it sounds like I am having the same issues. As I have said in this letter and many times over the phone, I would like the negative reporting to cease and past reporting removed since nothing has been proven and if in fact OCWEN after many years of trying can finally show me when my payments became late I will have no problem bringing my account current. OCWEN seems to operate in either secrecy or they just simply do n't seem to know what they are doing.

So on this particular day around XX/XX/XXXX, I called them to make payment arrangements because I was tired of the calls. The young lady quoted a high monthly figure over {$100.00}. I stated that I could not afford that. During this conversation, she used harsh tones that I made her aware of. She then stated that she could reduce the amount to {$100.00} monthly. I told her that was still too much. She stated she could n't go any lower. We had a verbal altercation and she boldly told me that the company had a lien on my house. There after the call ended with a payment due on the XXXX of every month. Around the XXXX of the month, I made a {$50.00} payment through my online banking, they received it XXXX XXXX, 2015. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a phone call from the same young lady stating that I did not abide by the verbal agreement of {$100.00}. I told her that I could not afford {$100.00} monthly that is why I sent {$50.00}. She was extremely rude. About XXXX minutes after that call, I called back, she answered and I asked to speak with her supervisor. I got a voicemail of a male. I could not hear his name because it was n't clear enough. I left a message. Moments later, I wrote a letter to the company about my experience with their rude employee. I then faxed it and sent a copy by certified mail. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I called back looking for the supervisor but was unsuccessful. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received what I call a threatening letter from the company which had no signature. On XXXX XXXX, I received {$50.00} from a friend to pay to make another payment because I did not want them to put a lien on my checking account like I was told they could do. My bank showed a payment date of XXXX XXXX, 2015, so I called the company XXXX XXXX to confirm the payment. The young man said he did not see a payment posted. I then called my bank and it was stated that they mailed the company the check on XXXX XXXX. I called the company back and told them that they should have received the check. The young lady told me they did not receive it and that they do n't control the mail. I told the young lady I believed someone was playing games and to post my check. Words were exchanged.

5/21/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I have been addressing these issues since XX/XX/XXXX when I was granted the attached loan modification by XXXX XXXX XXXX prior to the XXXX XXXX XXXX purchase and subsequent takeover followed by XXXX XXXX XXXX nullifying the loan modification after years of payments in XX/XX/XXXX, violating my consumer and constitutional rights with no recourse. 

I have addressed these issues both in writing and orally to Nationstar Mortgage but the account history discrepancies have been met with only resistance to include a "" pass the buck '' mentality and strategy by Nationstar Mortgage and a simple refusal to provide requested information or to even open an investigation with regard to the loan modification history on the mortgage loan per the attached. 

As a result of Nationstar 's blatant refusal to honor my claims to the point of investigation, Nationstar has left me with no choice but address these issues with the CFPB to finally get some answers as to how XXXX can execute a loan modification on my mortgage loan that neither XXXX XXXX XXXX nor Nationstar has any proof of when I possess the attached supporting documentation. I am confident that the actions would be of interest to the regulatory and government agencies that oversee the mortgage lending and mortgage servicing industries, which is why I have chosen to address this with the CFPB. 

NOTICE OF ERRORXXXX. I successfully entered into a permanent loan modification agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX beginning XX/XX/XXXX as evidenced by the attached notarized and fully executed loan modification agreement between me and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX. I am asserting that XXXX XXXX XXXX breached the loan modification agreement in XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to honor the loan modification and refused all future payments from me, resulting in breach of contract and wrongful foreclosure - Nationstar refuses to address it. 

XXXX. I am asserting that Nationstar Mortgage has taken no action in the "" breach of contract '' matter and has turned a blind 's eye to the serious consumer and constitutional mortgage servicing violations and breach of contract to further perpetuate the wrongful foreclosure of my property over and over again. 

REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONI would like for Nationstar as the current mortgage servicer on my loan to answer the following questions since XXXX XXXX XXXX has stated that they no longer own the loan and refuse to address these loan modification issues:XXXX Did I execute a loan modification agreement with XXXX XXXX Loans back in XX/XX/XXXX as evidenced by the attached? 

XXXX. When my mortgage loan was transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX, did XXXX XXXX XXXX honor the loan modification and if so, how long did XXXX XXXX XXXX honor it for and if canceled, please provide the reasons for cancelation. 

XXXX. Please provide a complete accounting of the mortgage loan from origination with XXXX to the XXXX XXXX XXXX transfer to the Nationstar Mortgage service transfer and please provide all documentation notifying me of each transfer and validating the mortgage loan balance for each transfer with each servicer. 

XXXX. Please provide a detailed explanation as to why XXXX XXXX XXXX accepted the modified mortgage loan payments from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX but refused to accept any further modified payments beginning XX/XX/XXXX ; please also outline the reasons for all actions commensurate with a cancelation of the attached loan modification agreement. 

XXXX. Please provide a detailed explanation of the actions that Nationstar Mortgage has taken in an effort to determine if the XX/XX/XXXX loan modification agreement was valid and why it was canceled upon receipt of many letters submitted by me detailing the situation to include proof of everything to support her claims of breach of contract. 

Thank you!

5/14/2016,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Investigation took too long,"Today, I received my Experian credit report number XXXX. Despite my student loans being repeatedly entered into the dispute cart, and my CFPB complaints as well as my few last revised reports listing them "" project completion date '' XXXX XXXX, XXXX, they are neither listed nor have been resolved. It is as though it was never disputed in the aggregate to begin with. Also, the math errors on the payment history are still there. I detailed that on a separate CFPB complaint using Experian 's own legend. So the time is quickly approaching in which the various copies of these things speaks to willful non-compliance of the FCRA. Only the math dispute with my utility company remains "" projected completion date '' XXXX XXXX. The most obviously-ignored error, that has continually been in dispute, falls on page XXXX of XXXX. It is "" XXXX XXXX '' and in this, case is proof of complete regard to the law. The reason for that is that I disputed it with both XXXX and XXXX, their server of this loan. I also disputed it with my U. S. Senator and the DOE. The letter received by both bank and servicer was willful non-compliance but was never formally addressed by Experian. They ca n't simply rubber-stamp the error and also just leave these on my report without a formal response. I have news for Experian : XXXX ' reply in particular must be independently verified. You ca n't just take their word for it because they furnish it. The truth is in the possession of all parties and I submitted all necessary paperwork on time and evidence of the fact is the positive XXXX on the other student loans. Those loans used identical information and no income verication and approved me. Only this student loan went rogue. They were not legally or ethically allowed to go rogue. Once disputed, they lied. All that is detailed in other CFPB complaints. Experian should obtain the XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX communication between the DOE and XXXX and my U. S. Senator to see that I not only supplied everything - and qualified - but I was singled out for default in a discriminatory way to serve a larger objective. Therefore, Experian is not dependent on a flimsy he said/she said investigation. Clearly, Experian removed these from the dispute entirely by not addressing them. Additionally, I stated in previous disputes and CFPB that all accounts related to XXXX cease and desist any reporting because of the fraudulent credit card they reported in XX/XX/XXXX, which has since been removed from my credit reports. XXXX sent a letter XXXX XXXX XXXX which upheld the error and refused to stop reporting it until XXXX. So clearly, the subsequent letters are an indication of that banks 's willful non-compliance inspite of the fact it was closed in XX/XX/XXXX ; time-barred in XX/XX/XXXX from reporting whether positive or negative ; there were XXXX consecutive months of positive payment history which I did not make but Experian 's fraud department did verify XXXX made ; XXXX admits none of 13 months but admits the one after it was closed in which no reporting happened and cited an internal computer update that caused external furnishing to credit reportibg agencies ; was probably an employee, given the furnishing was in fact by the bank ; etc. It is obvious that it had to be removed in spite of the letters received by XXXX. This casts a shadow on the student loan serviced by XXXX as well. XXXX basically mailed me envelopes yesterday, printed the day after this Experian report that reaffirmed multiple falsely furnished info as if facts are not important. Facts are stubborn things as XXXX XXXX once said. Facts are the basis for accurate reporting. Yet, I see today on this report that all that matters not. Much time has passed and I want answers as to Experian 's reason for ignoring ( on my U. S. Mail reports ) the previous disputes. I want Experian to stop this and take control of the situation and remove these until they get a proper investigation done.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian,MI,482XX,,Consent provided,Web,5/14/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,1925575

As I rarely actually write checks ( and usually to prepay my account -- which is why my water bill was only {$1.00} ), I was surprised when the check cleared so early. I contacted the bank ( Chase ) to find out what their policy was on depositing post-dated checks and was advised per "" whatever lame agreement they quoted me '' that they can basically post it whenever they want, with no regard whatsoever for the date. As the check is so small, and I had plenty of money in the account, this really was n't an issue. However, it is blatantly -- and unilaterally -- unfair to the average consumer that is relying on the date clearly written on the check to be honored to allow this practice. I guess this is one MORE reason to not write checks and to hate the US banking system.

11/25/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"I was in the process of re financing my home, I was working with a few different mortgage companies trying to find the best deal. XXXX of these companies was quicken loans. I made a decision to go with a local company but the banker I was dealing with at quicken loans using their aggressive tactics told me "" the rates went up this morning but lucky for you I locked you in already. '' Not knowing everything about mortgages like most people, He made me feel like I was already stuck and I had to go with him. So I went ahead and filled out the mortgage application and within minutes they had my credit card info and charged me a {$500.00} deposit for the appraisal and credit info. I felt this was quite quick but knew It was part of it so it was fine.. 
I was rubbed the wrong way from the very beginning and felt uncomfortable using this company, so I asked around and also the lender I wanted to work with and found out I can back out and cancel the loan and if I did it soon enough I could get all my {$500.00} back. So this is what I did, I called Monday morning the XXXX of XXXX and cancelled my loan. I told the banker I want to stay on the phone until it 's 100 % finished. He then told me it 's done. There is nothing more you need to do. I then asked him to transfer me to the right person to talk to about getting my refund to my credit card. As I spoke to the woman in that department she told me everything was final and it would take 7-10 business days and I would see my refund. So I waited until Friday XXXX XXXX and never saw my refund, so I called to find out what was going on. A lady in customer car looked up my info and said you 'll see it on Monday and to call again if it 's not there.. Monday comes, no refund. So today, Tuesday morning the XXXX of XXXX I called again to find out what 's going on. I get another lady in customer care, as she looks up my account she tells me they have n't even started the canceling process, and this process will take their team 8 days to complete and then the refund will come 7-10 business days from that. It has been 15 days and I will not receive my {$500.00} refund from a multi-billion dollar company for at least another 2-3 weeks! 5 weeks in total is completely unacceptable. It 's a credit card, very easy to refund a charge.. 
The high pressure, plus using tactics to make me feel trapped just to take my money as fast as possible and then give me the run around and hold my money hostage for as long as possible so they can make more money is downright disgraceful and I am absolutely disgusted with this company. Hopefully something happens with this and consumers are warned about working with any company like this.

I told them they needed to fix it as I am now required to make a payment on the original XXXX XXXX loan and with their loan, I now have a car payment of nearly {$900.00} instead of {$390.00} which is what they quoted and agreed to. I asked them to contact the original rep and have her fix it and they said no, would have to drive from new york where i now live to va - XXXX hours away and go into the branch.

I explained that i had XXXX, left my husband and had to move my house and business all in a 3 week span and she was not being very helpful.

5/14/2016,Credit card,,Credit card protection / Debt protection,,"I have spent countless hours speaking with Chase Customer Specialists/Supervisors and providing a significant amount of supporting documentation to no avail. The bottom line is that I purchased a log splitter manufactured by XXXX XXXX XXXX and sold to me by XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$3800.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I charged the purchase on my Visa Chase Freedom credit card. Despite my best efforts, XXXX did not ever make a serious effort to fix the splitter and XXXX refused to take the splitter back for a refund. It may interest you to know that at that time, XXXX was owned by XXXX XXXX and XXXX was owned by XXXX XXXX. Husband and wife - how convenient. 
In the course of my dispute ( XXXX ), I received Chase Cardmember Services correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
In reviewing all these documents my claim was denied ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) because the vendor cited "" several scratches and paint missing and it was used a lot and the splitter was not defective upon purchasing. 
Chase denied my claim on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating a significant amount of time had passed since the date of the charge. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Chase stated that the merchandise was received as described and the merchant had worked it out with me through the warranty process and unit was already used. 
First of all I sent XXXX and Chase photos of the mangled wedges on the splitter. These photos do not show paint missing and scratching. Secondly, it is ludicrous to state that the splitter was used a lot when I only had the splitter for a very short time. Lastly, the second opinion for XXXX. XXXX stated that the splitter was not abused but failed due to poor construction/design of the wedges. 
The XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Chase decision was perhaps the most infuriating to me. Although there is a 60 day time period to resolve the dispute, I was only informed by Chase to submit a response with a second opinion from a reliable merchant on the 54th day ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) of the 60 day cycle. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX immediately and told him of my dilemma of getting my response to him by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. He just told me to do the best I could. I provided all of the requested information to Chase by fax between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. By the way, subsequent to your XX/XX/XXXX letter I was informed by Chase that the XX/XX/XXXX letter was sent in error and my case was ongoing. Please review my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX fax to you which goes into greater detail. 
As for the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX decision, it is simply not true that the merchant had worked it out with me in the warranty process. 
I am requesting that Chase review my case. You have all the documentation and access to our recorded conversations which you state are for quality review. If you are serious about quality review and treating your customers fairly, you should take the time to review them. The only thing I can add is a copy of a XXXX/XXXX/XXXX letter from the West Virginia Attorney General to XXXX XXXX XXXX citing them for violation of the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act. 
I want you to know that I am a senior citizen living on a fixed income and this major purchase has been very upsetting to me. I do n't believe that Chase provided me the credit card protection that I was entitled to. If you need any further information, I would be happy to provide. I am trying to resolve this matter directly and honestly with you before pursuing other options.

8/11/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"I chose no overdraft on my account for a reason when I opened my account but Capital One allowed 2 transactions to go through my account and be paid that were over XXXX a piece on the same day when there was on XXXX dollars in my account instead of sending the payments back so that caused my account to be overdrawn and then on top of that Capital One charged me over XXXX NSF charges when they should not have paid those two checks. My issue is that the bank knowingly allowed these payments because the company who submitted the XXXX checks initially submitted a little over XXXX to the bank and they sent that back then the company split the payments into three checks and the bank accepted XXXX of them when there was not enough money to cover either of them at the time. So, I could n't bring my account current at that time due to other transactions coming out of my account so I paid it off slowly via my direct deposits from work and since it went over 30 days they charged off the account but did not close it because my direct deposits were still going to that account so I finally reached the payoff/charged off amount on XXXX and I am waiting on them to release my account back to full servicing but in the meanwhile, I wanted to send this complaint because had they not accepted those XXXX checks on the same day I would not have been charges so many fees and gone through this ordeal. If there is n't enough money in my account things should not be paid regardless of any other factors because that is for me to straighten out not for my bank to make that decision and then capitalize on it with all those fees. I believe Capital One did this on purpose because the XXXX check that the company submitted on the same day for around XXXX was sent back, all of them should have been sent back period due to the balance in the account.

I researched XXXX recovery and every single review said they were a scam. Both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX say an account was opened with my name and social and they last payment date was XXXX/XXXX/11. It was first reported on XXXX after it became a time-barred debt. I asked for debt verification from XXXX XXXX ( current debt owner ) and they told me they have to get the proof first. I have called Citibank 5 times and each time they have said they ca n't find and information on an account opened with my social security number or the account number that XXXX XXXX XXXX Equities gave to me. XXXX XXXX has not provided me with debt verification and has stated that they do n't even have proof of the account and that they have to get proof before they can send it to me. Citibank has no records of this account so where is XXXX XXXX going to get proof from? It has been put on my credit report and they have not provided any date the account was opened with Citibank only the last payment date ( XXXX/XXXX/11 ) meaning it is a time-barred debt by Texas standards and I was mostly likely underage at the time the account was opened. I have filed a police report and complaint with the FTC and XXXX XXXX has not acknowledged that. They want me to fill out a fraud packet that would be providing them with all my information ( social security, drivers license number, addresses ) without them having sent me proof of the account. They also said I only had ten days to return the packet to them after I received it. I spoke with someone at the FTC and he said that there should not be a time limit especially since they have n't provided me any information. Recently the debt owner on my XXXX credit report changed to XXXX XXXX XXXX even though the account is being disputed. XXXX XXXX 's phone number is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but the same address as XXXX XXXX. There are many concerning factors, so I do not trust sending all my personal information to them since neither I nor Citibank have any information on the account. They need to take this off of my credit report as it is a result of identity theft and they do n't have any proof and/or are unwilling to send me proof of the account. They also need to take it off because I was underage.

I have been working with the Ombudsman 's Office since XXXX 2015 ( Case # XXXX ) to try and resolve issues with my account serviced by Navient. This has resulted in Navient making numerous changes to my account that typically cause further problems that need to be addressed. These "" mistakes '' and "" errors '' on their part always seem to result in paying more money towards my loan in the long term or sending in additional payments just to get Navient to look at my complaint. 

Navient has issued documents regarding these changes and they have sent copies of these documents in a timely manner to the Ombudsman 's Office. They have told my case worker that they are also sending me these documents, but I do n't think they 're actually being sent ; they 've supposedly been sent several times through email and traditional paper mail, but never arrive. I have verified my contact info with Navient, so I know they have my correct email and physical address. 

I am concerned because this latest "" mistake '' on their part involved over {$4000.00} of interest being shown on my account that does n't belong there. I believe they are deliberately withholding documentation of changes being made to my account because it shows egregious and possibly fraudulent activity on their part. 

I am tired of being shuffled from agency to agency, with everyone who accepts a complaint either telling me it 's not in their jurisdictional authority or that they simply can not help.

Nationstar 's mishandling of my escrow account has caused me significant hardship. Nationstar knew that I was struggling after the rate increase XX/XX/XXXX, when I submitted a request for loan modification, which was rejected. Nationstar knew I was struggling, and yet they manipulated my escrow account in order to force upon me another increase, in total XXXX % increase in one year, in an attempt to force me into foreclosure. This appears to be a pattern for Nationstar : for customers in trouble, after a rate hike follow up with another increase in escrow. I found many such instances on XXXX. 

Regarding my escrow account, I want to take over and manage my own expenses : it will be simpler and more efficient for Nationstar. Prior to Nationstar, I have been making payments to XXXX XXXX for 6 years, always on time, never missed a payment.",,Nationstar Mortgage,CA,908XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,7/1/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,1994458

1/27/2016,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Public record,"Several months ago I began inquiring into my credit as I keep hearing that we should make sure that no fraud is going on with your information. When I saw my report I did n't see any fraud but I did see a lot of information that was incorrect. I began the process of disputing the accounts with all XXXX national credit bureaus to have the inaccurate information corrected. For the most part it went smoothly. XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and Equifax managed to delete or correct all the accounts that I disputed on their respective databases. The problem began when I re-ran a full report to see what my report looked like after all the accounts were corrected. 

Although Equifax corrected or deleted all the accounts I had disputed, they added an additional public record on my report for {$38000.00}. Because I had already disputed over {>= $1,000,000} in erroneous public record debt from my report, and Equifax had already investigated and corrected them all, I assumed this was just an oversight on their part. I decided to dispute the account from my report thinking it would be corrected as I do not owe the debt. Well Equifax came back stating that the record was verified. When I received their results XX/XX/XXXX I decided to look up my personal records to figure out when I filed Bankruptcy as my memory is n't exactly what it used to be and I was sure that I filed any and all tax liens on my Bankruptcy. Sure enough my Bankruptcy was both filed and discharged in 2011 which was several years after the tax lien was filed. Because I had my records in order I decided to have Equifax re-investigate this account as it is obviously not owed. Once again Equifax gave me results on XXXX XXXX stating this was verified. 

At this point I am getting increasingly frustrated at Equifax as they are claiming to verify information that is impossible to verify. There is no debt owed as all my debt including tax liens from before 2011 were discharged trough my Bankruptcy. Equifax is either not investigating properly or not investigating at all. I would like you to look into this for me as I am XXXX and have little taste for nor the inclination for a lengthy and expensive litigation. However if it is what I must do to clear my good name I will be forced to do so. I am just hoping that through your investigation Equifax will see the error of their ways and will correct their misrepresentation of my credit and name.

3/30/2015,Debt collection,Credit card,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"I believe that Citibank erroneously issued me a XXXX, Cancellation of Debt. I sent a package to Citibank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX with the necessary documentation, including my credit reports back to XX/XX/XXXX, but have had no response from Citibank. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I received a collection notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX requesting over {$42000.00} for Citibank account with the number ending in XXXX. I checked my quick books records as well as my credit reports and found no credit card with that number. I disputed the debt with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In response I received some statements from Citibank showing balances of {$37000.00}, {$38000.00}, etc with interest accruing at approximately {$1000.00} a month. I responded to Citibank with information regarding the statements and the fact that the card does not appear on my credit report. I have a copy of that letter. 

I heard nothing from either XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX or Citibank until a XXXX was issued in an amount just over {$17000.00} for the XX/XX/XXXX tax year. 

This erroneous XXXX will have serious ramifications for me and not just any potential tax liability. The IRS can unwind any erroneous tax calculation at any time. However, this error impacts my XXXX subsidy and my son 's college financial aid. Our FAFSA will need to be linked to our XX/XX/XXXX XXXX before the fall term. I will be able to demonstrate actual damages that may NOT be able to be rectified, i.e. my son 's Financial Aid which has strict deadlines, if this matter is not looked into and investigated. It needs to be resolved promptly. 

Interestingly, I was sued by Citibank back in XX/XX/XXXX for a little over {$16000.00}. Citibank continues to collect on that judgment, issuing garnishments, etc. The lawsuit filed by Citibank states that this is for an account ending in XXXX, however, subsequent exhibits attached to a Motion for Summary Disposition ( of which I do not have copies but the court and Citi 's law firm, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX should have copies ) included statements for an account ending not only in XXXX but also XXXX. Both those accounts are reflected on my credit reports. I believe that the XXXX account number changed when XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was acquired by Citibank, hence XXXX numbers for the XXXX account. That suit was filed in the XXXX District Court in XXXX XXXX, Michigan, case number XXXX. ( The XXXX is for XXXX XXXX since the court also meets in XXXX and XXXX ). 

In summary, I have no records of any credit card with this number. Not in my accounting software nor in my handwritten hard copy back up. It has never appeared on my credit report, at least since I have regularly pulled those reports starting in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX all my accounts were reported as current. There is no record of this credit card from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. When asked for any proof, all that was provided were some recent statements that showed no activity, just a past due balance accruing interest. I was sued by CitiBank back in XX/XX/XXXX for an almost identical amount. Citibank has a judgment on that amount and their attorneys continue collection procedures.

They told me they could n't help me until I was severely delinquent. I applies for XXXX job a day. It took several months to regain employment. I was out of cash and living off of my credit cards. Wells fargo offered a loan modification. I was told during a "" recorded call '' that This "" would n't '' impact my credit score and that the modified portion of payment difference would be added onto the end of my loan when I got back to work. 
I was having the payments deducted from my checking account for a year. Wells fargo reported to the credit bureaus that I was n't making "" any '' payment. I have proof of the checking account deductions. At the end of one year, I re-applied for a loan modification and was told I needed to file my taxes and re-apply. Each time I reached out to the loan specialists it would take XXXX14 day to hear back from him. This is a time sensitivesituation. 
One week later I filed my taxes and made XXXX attempts to reach my loan specialist. I left long detailed messages each time. My cell phone bill shows the calls and duration of each. The loan specialists never called back but continued to send letters offering his help. He would not call me back. I received a letter stating the foreclosure process has started. Wells fargo lied about the terms and conditions of the loan modification process. I asked so many questioned that the loan specialist had to keep putting my on hold to ask his supervisor the answer. These calls are recorded. I do n't see why I have to be subjected to proving my case when the recordings have all the proof. I asked to make a payment arrangement and spread out XXXX of my back payments and I could give them XXXX in cash. The loan modification ended in XXXX XXXX. I called to ask what the next steps were and was given the run around about what to do next. I was told just wait. We will send you a packet. 3 wks later a packet arrived with a deadline in 7 days of receiving it. It was dated 3 weeks prior to my receiving it. They would n't accept a paymnet in XXXX when I called to inquire about my payments. I was told underwriting is working on it. I know it is important to have the documents correct but they picked apart every thing from the size and direction of the faxed documents to oh we lost it, Can you resend it. They even sent my a refund of almost {$600.00}. SAYING THESE FUNDS WERE N'T APPLIED CORRECTLY PRIOR TO THE FORCLOSURE PROCESS STARTING. They refused any payment via phone unless it was the total amount due. 
I can not believe lenders are n't more closely regulated to prevent these misrepresentations of the facts and processes supposedly mandated by law. 
This is theft. Wells Fargo is stealing my home that I worked hard to maintain and for 8 years was never late once until the lay off. Unbelievable.

Instead, they passed me around to numerous departments that had no idea how to process the refund and said I needed to speak to someone else. The final person I spoke to refused to do a refund. XXXX and chase conspired to prevent me from receiving a benefit they said I was entitled to by making it impossible to connect to the person that was handling it already and playing a game of pass the potatoe so that I would go away due to being annoyed and frustrated and they would keep the bag fee I should not have been assessed in the first instance.

The hospital registration erroneously thought I and my father were the same since we have the same basic names- XXXX XXXX XXXX although I have a XXXX name which is XXXX XXXX My father was n't able to pay some of his bills since he does n't have insurance. Unfortunately the hospital used my SS # and assigned it to my father 's account. This was sent over to the collection agency PROCOLLECT. Since it 's my SS # my credit report and score are now adversely affected. I contacted ProCollect and even sent documents so they can change the SS # to my father 's but they refused to help me. The account manager, XXXX, even accused me of taking over my father 's debt, saying I am now responsible for it. I did not sign any paper to assume my father 's debt, and XXXX could n't produce XXXX. I have contacted the hospital too, they sent me a letter apologizing for their mistake. Their business office, according to them, has contacted ProCollect so they can correct the error and XXXX the hospital assured me that ProCollect promised to fix the error which has not happened. 
I am writing to please beg and implore to help me with this situation. I can still open new credits but with less favorable terms. I want to shop for auto and home insurance but I get less favorable quotes because my credit score plunged from XXXX to XXXX. All I 'm asking is for ProCollect to change the SS # on file on my father 's record from mine to his since the debt in question is not mine. Until this day they refuse to do so and I am being punished for something I did not do nor obligated to settle. I will attach documents as soon as I know how to do so. Thank you very much

I then received yet another escrow analysis from Ocwen, stating that my anticipated escrow payments for the next year total {$2600.00}. My property taxes are {$730.00}, my homeowner 's insurance is about {$1200.00} - Ocwen is basing estimated payments on the OLD insurance premium of {$1800.00}.

5/14/2015,Debt collection,Mortgage,Improper contact or sharing of info,Talked to a third party about my debt,"I filed for a chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX of XXXX. I received a discharge in XXXX of XXXX. At the time I had a mortgage with Chase Bank. This mortgage was included in my bankruptcy and was discharged. I have been dealing with continued attempts by Chase to inaccurately report information to all credit bureaus. Currently, my complaint is with the credit bureau XXXX. I have filed numerous disputes with them in regards to wrong information that Chase Bank has reported to their agency. At the time of my bankruptcy I had XXXX mortgage and only XXXX with Chase Bank. On my credit file they list XXXX separate accounts. They have XXXX separate account numbers act # XXXX, and act # XXXX, and all other information is different by only a few days or months. They list the date the account was opened on XXXX as XXXX XXXX and on the other as XXXX XXXX, XXXX, they list the date of first delinquency on XXXX as XXXX and the other as XXXX, they list the date account was closed on XXXX as XXXX, and the other does not have a closed date. The account # XXXX has a reported balance of {$0.00} and the status lists Included in Bankruptcy and under comments it says Bankruptcy Capter XXXX, Bankruptcy Discharged, Last reported XXXX. Account # XXXX lists the status 120+ days past due, also with a balance of {$0.00}, but last reported on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Due to this current reporting it is appearing as though I have a current mortgage account open which is significantly affecting my credit score. I have reported this to XXXX in several disputes as stated with no results or changes. I have also called Chase bank who stated to me that this account is being listed because the mortgage was sold prior to my discharge so therefore they had the right to list it and report on it. They also stated that they were not aware that I had had a bankruptcy or had received a discharge. I explained to them that they already have an account with Chase that lists on my credit report as being discharged in bankruptcy and I also asked them how can I have an account with a XXXX balance yet be currently 120+ days late? I also told them that all the information under this "" Bogus '' account had dates listed that were not accurate with the account I had at the time nor did it match up with the payment grid they have listed attached to this particular report, in fact this particular report lists that I am current as of XXXX of XXXX. I again repeated I do not have an account with Chase Bank currently open and the "" XXXX '' mortgage I had was discharged in a chapter XXXX back in XXXX. I also stated that it is a violation of the provisions of the FCRA to be reporting on an account that was included in my bankruptcy, that they should no longer be reporting on as being unpaid or in a past due status. This does not seem to matter to Chase Bank! 
Please, help me if you can. I have had impeccable payment history since my discharge and am trying so hard and yet I am continuing to be penalized by Chase for the mistakes and problems of my past. Also, even though the other account listed is listed properly is n't that account suppose to be part of my public record report? The reason I ask is that XXXX lists that I have XXXX public record and XXXX Negative accounts, both being the XXXX Chase Accounts. 

Thank you very much, XXXX XXXX XXXX

Prior to this I knew something was hairy with the account but they were all small purchases and places that I had shopped before. I had no proof of anything. At that time there was a significant amount of money in the account from a settlement I had received from a car accident to which I sustained XXXX injuries from. It was in there temporarily until I could put it in something else. After the breach was confirmed I was devastated. I would stare at these statements for hours just in tears. Finally I pulled out a calendar and every receipt I had and went to work. XXXX. I put the first set of claims in XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter for each individual claim an affidavit was mailed I filled it out and sent it back. A provisionary credit was credited to my account about 10 days later with a letter for each individual amount stating it was a provisionary credit. They were still investigating and after 3 months if they found fraudulent purchases the money they credited would remain permanent. In the meantime we had to put freezes on both my and my husbands credit because we did n't know how far it had gone. They did get my email.I did try several times to put in more claims through customer service but was accidentally disconnected several times. I did n't want to put in any more claims until I new for sure they were going to remain permanent because of the XXXX toll it was taking on me. XX/XX/XXXX I received individual letters for each individual amount stating that the investigation was complete and the credits would remain permanent. May I add that during this time I would call Customer Service making them aware that there was additional claims to be put in still. 
Immediately following the XX/XX/XXXX decision I started putting in more claims. I was aware that it was after the 60 days but these were not your normal circumstances. I received the affidavit filled it out sent it back but that was as far as it went. A month went by and I heard nothing. How can they just not respond? As I am still waiting on a response I get a phone call XXXX. My file was sent to her and she just wanted the backstory of everything. So I gave it to her. She assured me XXXX times she was going to do everything she could for me. Not to worry. All of the additional claims were going to go through her at this point. Im thinking great i do n't have to deal with customer service being rude or hanging up on me or asking me questions which is not there job. This will all be over soon I will get my money back and can put this behind me. Reminding you that I am on XXXX. as of now I have been XXXX my body aches all day long and I ca n't sleep. The worst thing I can do is add stress to my life. Instantly I have XXXX. It takes me 4 weeks to get ahold of this women again. I think I am supposed to put the claims in through her. I finally reach her she says oh no thats my fault all claims still need to initially be put in through customer service. I just wasted XXXX more weeks. I faxed her paperwork straight from the bank. She lost it. Had to do it again. Finally I get a letter in XXXX about those claims that was dated XX/XX/XXXX that they were denied because it was passed 60 days. Then theeir is another claim she just completely ignored. I would call her leave messages sometimes 6 a day. Never got a call back. She never worked on my file. The latest thing to happen was the last set of claims was put back in my account end of XXXX. XXXX. Then it was taken out without notice on XX/XX/XXXX. I was blindsided.

Saying that I have unsatisfactory case from Bank of America credit card amount of {$10000.00} that I owed and asking for settle amount of 50 % otherwise they will get a judgement and sue me .... 
I thought this account might have missed during the bankruptcy. After checking my file from the attorney and credit report that I pulled after 3 month later after bankruptcy, it clearly said that this account was "" Discharged through Bankruptcy Chapter XXXX '' So, I called back to them trying to avoid unnecessary future hassle and I informed them about the discharge. Now they are saying to me that "" This particular account 's discharge was fraud, therefore The bank of America sold this account to us to recover their loss '' also said there was breech of contract that I violated with BOA for this account in order to get a bankruptcy and asking me XXXX % of settlement instead of XXXX %. They basically told me that there was fraud on my discharge. But I did everything legitimately through my attorney and had no problem at all for 6 years.Is this scam?

I 've also asked that my issue be escalated to management but still have not received any contact from anyone with authority.

The original creditor is XXXX, arising from a final bill from an apartment that I moved out of in XXXX XXXX. In XXXX XXXX I received a letter from a debt collector asking for payment of {$140.00}. I mailed a payment via my credit union 's bill pay on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for the full amount due. The letter, which purported to be from an XXXX office in XXXX, TN, instructed to make checks payable to XXXX XXXX. 
In XXXX XXXX, I received a bill for the same amount from a separate collection agency for the same debt. The agency is XXXX, XXXX After double-checking that I had already paid, I assumed they had some wires crossed, so I ignored the bill. 
On XXXX I received another bill from XXXX, so I called them to explain that I had already paid the bill. They demanded proof from me rather than checking with XXXX. Because the payment was made via bill pay, I will have to go into my credit union branch to get a copy. This will be time consuming and annoying. I feel the burden should be on the collection agency to ask their client to double check their records. In the meantime, my credit score has been harmed by the report to credit bureaus by XXXX. 
Today, I received a bill from Stellar Recovery , Inc. for the same debt, dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX is continuing collection efforts of a debt that has been paid for almost a year.

The program promises to provide tens of thousands of XXXX XXXX points, if a customer opens a CitiGold checking account and completes a number of steps such as setting up bill payments online within a few months. I signed up for the offer and opened an account XX/XX/2016. I also went to a local branch to provide my information such as tax record, social security number, etc. to complete account opening process. 

To set up bill payment ( a requirement for receiving the benefits ), I need an online account ; to set up the online account, I need a debit card and a password ; the problem is I have never received the debit card and password for several months and now the required timeline has elapsed. After speaking with customer service XX/XX/XXXX, I did receive a debit card, but the password never arrived. Meanwhile, because there is XXXX balance in my account, I was left with account maintenance and overdraft fees of at least {$64.00} as of XXXX XXXX, 2016. 

Citi 's practice is unfair. I opened the account and was willing to complete the steps required to take advantage of the offer. However, an essential part of what is required - receiving debit card and password - is missing due to Citi 's lack of oversight of its operations. What started as an attractive incentive program ended up in fees on my account and no benefits at all, and there 's nothing I can do to avoid it.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Citibank,DC,200XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/11/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,2007120

It did not go through so I tried to log into my bank account using my phone app. The app said I needed to update my password and wanted to send a confirmation code to phone numbers that were not mine. I went to the bank first thing this morning. The assistant branch manager sat with me and looked at my checking account and we saw that a XXXX withdrawal from paypal hit my account on XX/XX/XXXX, followed by a {$150.00} withdrawal, neither which I had any knowledge of. I contacted XXXX, while I was sitting at the bank this morning, and verified that the charges were coming through because the hacker knew my bank account information. The assistant branch manager spent an hour with me filing the fraud complaint. It dawned on me to look at my other XXXX savings accounts. Turns out the new savings account I opened on XX/XX/XXXX with a {$25.00} deposit, had been drained by the same XXXX withdrawee on XX/XX/XXXX, two days after I opened the account. We then spend another XXXX minutes filing the fraud complaint for the savings account hack. The reason I came into the branch on XXXX was to get a card replacement because mine was cracking in half. On XX/XX/XXXX I was told a new card would be coming with about 5 days. I found out today that the card was never ordered. Today the assistant branch manager offered to expedite the delivery of my replacement card. After I left the branch today, I tried to make an online purchase, and the card did not go through. I called my bank, figuring I needed to authorize the charge because of the fraud complaint I filed this morning. The representative tells me that the bank put a fraud hold on my account last night when I was trying to make an online purchase, because they thought it was suspicious, even though this is a payment I 've made twice I the past with no problems. I asked why I had n't been notified about this potential fraud, and why had n't the assistant branch manager who is sat with for 1.5 hours earlier today, told me anything about the suspected fraud hold placed on my card. She said they had notified me via a phone call. I asked what phone number they called. My bank had XXXX phone numbers on file for me, XXXX of which are completely foreign to me. They called the wrong phone numbers. They are currently unable to tell me how these phone numbers it to my account. I feel that they are bungling the fraud that is being committed against me, and they have also bungled potential fraud that they are misidentifying. I let the operator I was speaking with today know that I would filing a complaint with the CFPB and it was her duty to also file a complaint on my behalf. She said the representative I was being transferred to would take care of that for me. They let me know that our conversations were being recorded. Thank you for any help you can provide in getting this matter resolved.

They said it was my problem to find out any additional information relating to this debt and hung up.

10/8/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"I have a fixed rate student loan for an 84 month term at 5.65 % ( a discounted rate because I have automatic ACH deduction ). After 12 months of payments, which were not calculated correctly for that interest rate for an 84 month period, I received a letter telling me my payment was increasing due to an interest rate change. The higher payment is being deducted from my checking account. I have attempted to resolve this issue with AES several times -- XXXX phone calls and XXXX letter, to which they have not responded. Below is the text of the letter I sent to them. 

XX/XX/2015To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to question a change in the terms of my student loan. I spoke to XXXX different representatives about this issue on XXXX separate occasions, neither of whom could give me accurate information. 
Several months ago, I received a letter from AES stating that my monthly payment would increase in XX/XX/XXXX because of a change in interest rates. NOTE : My loan is a fixed rate. At that time I spoke to a representative who assured me that the letter had gone out in error, because it was the time of year that interest rates changed for those who have variable rate loans. I accepted her response. 
About a month later, I received the same letter, but ignored it, assuming it was simply sent in error again. However, the new ( increased ) payment amount was deducted from my checking account in XX/XX/XXXX. I called again and spoke to XXXX, who attempted to explain why the payment had increased. Her explanation made little sense. The bottom line is, the new terms of the loan mean that I will pay MORE over the life of the loan than the loan contract states. 
Here are my calculations : The loan agreement was originally for {$13000.00} at 5.65 % ( ACH deduction discount ) for a term of 84 months. 
According to XXXX 's loan calculator, my monthly payment should have been {$190.00} for 84 months, resulting in a total paid of {$16000.00}. Instead, the payment was set at {$190.00} for the first twelve months. I understand that the interest rate was correct, but the payment amount was not. Why was n't the payment adjusted to reflect the discounted interest rate for having ACH withdrawal? 
The total paid for the first twelve months was {$2300.00} The new monthly payment is {$200.00} for a term of 71 months. That is a total of {$14000.00} plus {$2300.00} = {$16000.00} That is a difference of {$290.00} more I will pay than I should. 
Clearly, the months remaining should not be XXXX, but XXXX. More important, why are the loan terms changing when I have a signed contract stating I would pay over 84 months? 
The representative ( XXXX ) I spoke to did not understand the simple math I tried to explain to her. She insisted I would not pay more because more was going on the principal. I asked her to please send me some documentation to explain what she was talking about, and all I received was a print-out of the last XXXX payments, which is something I can access online, and which is not helpful in explaining anything. ( As an aside, XXXX was very patient and pleasant, if not knowledgeable or helpful. ) I have had many loans in my lifetime, and I have never had a change in terms for a fixed rate loan. I question the legality of a change in terms, and will challenge it if necessary. I am frustrated that I have had to spend several hours on the phone ( with at least 20 minutes on hold : why not hang up and call me back later? ), researching rates and writing this letter. 
I would appreciate your attention to this matter.

1/21/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Using a debit or ATM card,,"Good Morning, Last Saturday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, while I was out with my friends I tried accessing my account through my phone, but I was denied. When I came home, I called the after hours and the representative told me that she ca n't do anything since the hold is for security and fraud. I told her that in the past i used to get a text showing what charges what made to the account and for me to verified by clicking "" OK ''. She told me that all my account is on hold that I would have to wait until the next business days to talk to the checking account department ( this means I have to wait until Tuesday since Monday was XXXX holiday ). Frustrated, I ask to talk to the supervisor which she took my number to give for a call back. I did n't get any call back. In fact, I got irritated when she started changing the tone of her voice in the process. Since I did n't get any phone call from the call back, I called the next day ( Sunday ) to see if I can talk to the credit card department. I was desperate to find out what was wrong of my account. Why is it that my entire account was on hold, including my kids accounts, which one of them are away in college and depend on his debit card. While waiting for the credit card representative to answer, i was asked if i could do the survey, which i did! For some reason the survey started for me to do. Since I did n't get any of the credit card representatives online, my answers to the survey were all "" XXXX ''. A few minutes later, a gentlemen called me asking how he can help me. He is from the credit card department and wondering why my answers to the survey were "" XXXX ''. I told him that I did n't get anyone online and the questions are all about the representative that supposedly helping me. I told him that i needed to talk to someone at the accounts department regarding a hold of my account. He also mentioned that my account is blocked, but I should be able to use my credit card, which the other after hour representative did n't mention ( a little relief since I do n't have any other account and credit from another institutions ). He transferred me to the accounts department and a pleasant and patient lady answered. She mentioned that the hold is from the security department for security review. She was very patient and listened to my frustration. I did n't understand why my entire accounts was on hold and i had no access to my funds for food or gas. On top of it, i was n't told until Sunday afternoon that my USAA credit card is available. I did n't bother to check if I have access to my credit card since my entire USAA account was on hold for security review. Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2016, I called and inquire about the hold. I was transferred to a someone and she explained to me that my account is security review for 48 business hours. She also mentioned that it was in the disclosures that they provided to the members when we open the accounts. The problem i have with this hold is why would you hold the account for review on a weekend when you know that there is no one working at the security department for review in the weekend? I needed to put gas in my car and my son uses his debit card for food while in campus. The bank left me hanging without any cash for food and gas this past weekend and the after hour representative did n't bother to tell me that i still have access to my credit cards and did n't bother to transfer me to the accounts department ( after hours ) to give me some kind of explanation of why my entire account was on hold. 
I apologize for the lengthy message, but it has been a long and frustrating weekend for me not being able to access my account. I have to tell my son to borrow money from his friends for food since his debit card was also frozen.

Upon calling them a second time today, I was subsequently told that everyone in that department was in a meeting, and to again try back later. 

Upon further research I discovered a litany of complaints, poor reviews and suggested illegal activity surrounding this company on multiple sites, and additionally discovered they are not accredited by the XXXX.

4/13/2016,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"In my original claim, CFPB and Ocwen addressed my complaint by focusing on the paper work and what the loan modification read. The deferred principal and loan modification are key parts, but this is about errors, lies and deception by Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC, to keep us in a house that was underwater. We relied on the deceitful information Ocwen sent us, upon which we made financial decisions, that damaged us financially. This is a claim and a complaint against Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC, not against the loan or a question of what is written in the modification documents. The original loan servicer, XXXX, convinced us to go into foreclosure in XXXX to get a loan modification and in XXXX, XXXX that happened, which increased our loan over {$40000.00} from an original amount of {$330000.00} to over {$360000.00}. We filed bankruptcy in XXXX XXXX and the loan became non-recourse. Ocwen took over the servicing and in XXXX, XXXX told us in writting that {$85000.00} of the loan could be forgiven, not deferred. The house was about {$90000.00} underwater, needed a lot of repair and we would have given it back, non-recourse and started over. Their own attorney stated "" the statements were intended to encourage you to continue to make timely payments, which is exactly what you did '' and stay in the house and spend money on it, thinking we had {$85000.00} in equity, at a time there was negative equity in the house. Two years later, upon my request for paper work, Ocwen told me the {$85000.00} was not forgiven and since that time they have been delaying and passing us around in an apparent attempt to get us to go away, get frustrated or get more value for the house in an improving market. They also were very eager to provide documents for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. 

We lost everything in the recession, had to go through a loan modification that increased our loan over {$40000.00} from the original amount, filed bankruptcy, my wife was given XXXX, my father-in-law was going through a divorce at XXXX, our house needed a ton of work and I am XXXX XXXX XXXX with no XXXX. There were other opportunities out there for us to start over, rather than be at least {$90000.00} underwater, which this house was. 

In terms of financial damages, in XXXX XXXX our house was still about {$90000.00} underwater and it made sense to give it back if the {$85000.00} was not forgiven. Ocwen confirmed that the {$85000.00} was forgiven in the letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. We have spent over {$50000.00} on the house with the assumption the {$85000.00} was forgiven and it still needs about {$60000.00} more spent on it to get to what Ocwen claims is the fair market value. Then we would still loose about {$60000.00} plus opportunity cost of a new house of at least {$140000.00}, without the {$90000.00} loss. My math says that is about {$250000.00} and damages. 

Is there any program with CFPB or the regulators, that can help me pursue this claim or do I need to involve my attorney? 
Thank you for your time, XXXX XXXX

I cant get a hold of anyone to help me, nor can I afford an attorney. Green Tree has several of these same issues against them and we all experiencing credit issues.

3/14/2016,Credit card,,Billing statement,,"SUMMARY : I signed up for an Amazon card late last year which reflects charges I do n't recall making. I received XXXX email letting me know I was past due in XXXX and XXXX paper invoices ( XXXX and XXXX in XXXX of XXXX ), but neither of the notices listed the line items for the charges. I now have a collections agency after me and despite my multiple attempts to find out what the charges are for, I can not get an answer. 
BACKGROUND : In XXXX of XXXX, I received my first email from Amazon.com telling me my card is past due. I attempted to log into my account to understand what those charges are. I successfully logged into my Amazon.com account, but the Amazon Credit Card required a separate log which I do not have, nor did I ever have XXXX. I then attempted to log in through the "" I forgot my user name '' and then "" I forgot my password '' and could not get in. 
On XXXX XXXX, I called the Amazon Credit Card / Synchrony bank and managed to get my account number. While on the phone, I requested information on the charges. I had my address, SSN and any security information, but they told me they could not see what the charges were for. 
I then attempted to log into my account again, I entered my credit card number and it came back to me with, "" card not registered ''. 
I received XXXX paper invoice in the mail while I was out of town a few weeks ago. Today, I received a second invoice and notice from a collection agency for my Amazon Credit Card. 
I called the collection agency, they transferred me around a few times and I finally made it to a manager. I spoke with "" XXXX XXXX '' XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX about the collection notice. Explained I made several attempts to understand what the charges are for and I still do not have an answer. Therefore, it is difficult for me to send anyone any money unless I know the charges belong to me. She said she would "" request for a letter '' to find out what those charges are for, but I had to pay her {$25.00} in order to remove the "" delinquent '' status on my account. I explained I am not willing to pay any money until I know what the charges are. She told me to call customer service at Synchrony. 
I called Synchrony, entered my credit card number and last XXXX digits on my Social Security Number. I made it to a representative, explained the situation and they said they "" have limited access and I would have to call customer service ''. When I got off the phone I realized the number the collector and Synchrony gave me were XXXX and the same. 
If I did make the charge and I can not recall, I am more than happy to pay for the items, but I find it difficult to pay for something I do n't even know if it belongs to me and it is impossible for me to find out. 
I can use your assistance in finding out what the purchases were for and if they do belong to me. 
Thank you.

5/18/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I have been fighting a fraudulent mortgage situation for over 4 years now. Original lender claims to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX. Caliber Home Loans claims to be the new servicer. Servicing transfer took place in XX/XX/XXXX. Caliber began sending me monthly statements in XX/XX/XXXX. Prior to the loan being sold, original lender filed a foreclosure action against me, which I contested and it is now sitting dead in the courts. Caliber has taken NO legal action regarding this account, and I have confirmed this by speaking with Caliber 's claimed attorney and also by checking routinely with my court clerk 's office. In other words, the "" foreclosure '' status of this account has always been the same since before Caliber began contacting me. I have many disputes with Caliber, but Caliber has either ignored my disputes completely or has responded by answering questions that I have never asked. 
Caliber stopped sending me monthly statements after XX/XX/XXXX, and when I have asked about this, Caliber states to me that they can not send me a statement because they claim to be actively foreclosing on me. Again, I have spoken to Caliber 's own attorney, and have confirmed that Caliber has not taken ANY action against me whatsoever. I mentioned Regulation Z to Caliber, and how it requires them to provide monthly statements regardless of foreclosure status, because foreclosure status is not listed in the law as an exemption. The loan is a conventional loan, so the statute applies. I have not filed bankruptcy, and Caliber is not a small mortgage servicer under the law 's definition. Caliber refuses to provide me with monthly statements. I did just receive an "" informational statement '' which appears to be what is provided when the consumer has filed bankruptcy, but again, we have not filed BK. This statement does not include much of the information that Regulation Z requires servicers to report to the consumer on periodic statements. I called Caliber today to ask about this, and was told that the statement was generated due to a payment that was made on the account. I did not make the payment they are claiming. I am concerned about the lack of monthly statements because Caliber has shown a pattern of adding fees and charges to this loan that are not legal, and without the monthly statements, I can not keep track of what is happening on that front. Caliber also has a history with me of changing their story on a constant basis, so that information provided today contradicts Caliber 's own earlier provided info. 

I am in the process of trying to resolve several other disputes with Caliber, but at this time, I am only disputing the issue of the monthly statements here with the CFPB. Caliber is required to provide this documentation to me in accordance with Regulation Z, as amended in XX/XX/XXXX, and is refusing to do so.

Briefly, my elderly, XXXX, XXXX father got a reverse mortgage from XXXX Mortgage ( now dba Reverse Mortgage Answers ) of XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

His mortgage was shrouded with fraud from day XXXX when ( per an undated Underwriting Conversation Log ) even before he got that reverse mortgage an appraiser concealed from the underwriter the presence of a highly-visible, income-producing commercial cell tower XXXX XXXX permit records confirm was built in XXXX. Because of actions by both XXXX Mortgage personnel and its appraiser XXXX XXXX, the underwriter approved a reverse mortgage that illegally encumbered his XXXX farm included that commercial cell tower. 

After all, FHA underwriting guidelines for reverse mortgages ( and also those of RMS ) strictly prohibit reverse mortgages on income-producing properties. That highly-visible, income-producing commercial cell tower that XXXX built two years before my father got that reverse mortgage made my father 's property ineligible for a reverse mortgage as is. XXXX Mortgage ( now dba Reverse Mortgage Answers XXXX ) should have hired a surveyor and surveyed out that excess land including that cell tower. It did n't. That made this a fraudulent mortgage. 

That fraud also involved Reverse Mortgage Solutions ( RMS ). Although their guidelines also prohibit reverse mortgages on income-producing properties, their appraiser XXXX XXXX continued the fraudulent masquerade by not mentioning that cell tower or its income in his appraisal. That 's strange, since he included a photo of that cell tower in his appraisal report which I received from RMS official XXXX XXXX. ( See side-view color photo on page XXXX of his appraisal report. ) NOW ABOUT ALL THAT ROBO-SIGNING : Less than one month later after my father got his reverse mortgage, there began a series of "" Assignment of Deed '', etc., in which ownership of his reverse mortgage was transferred from XXXX Mortgage to XXXX Mortgage, from XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and then from XXXX XXXX XXXX to Reverse Mortgage Solutions ( RMS ). 

Problem is, ALL three assignments of deeds were shrouded in ROBO-SIGNING. Signatures included those of the notorious XXXX XXXX of "" XXXX Minutes '' fame who was the # XXXX robo-signer in the country. And XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX address was that of XXXX XXXX Bank office. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX of the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation for the State XXXX told me that she contacted RMS and asked them to halt foreclosure efforts. XXXX decided not to honor her request. 

Today is Friday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Yesterday afternoon I received in the mail a simple white non-descript # XXXX envelope from XXXX ' attorneys XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that contained a one-page notice of a pending foreclosure sale. The notice was dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The sale is scheduled for XXXX XXXX, XXXX. That 's less than a two-week notice. 

Robo-signing is illegal. Plus, it 's also the root of numerous lawsuits. Just check out XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX. Also check out XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

At the same time I contacted the creditors in question per my right under the FCRA. I have received no response from the creditors and the credit bureau has stated that they verified the accuracy. I have requested in XXXX separate letters the "" verification of procedures '' on how they contacted and verified these accounts in question. They have failed to provide this to me in writing. The issue I 'm having is that if the creditor supposedly verified with the credit bureau then why did they not verify with me, the alleged debtor. 

Experian has failed to comply with the federal laws in place to protect consumers from inaccurate or false reporting. This lack of due process and disregard for the federal mandate has placed a burden on my credit report and my family 's future. 

Please assist because I have no other way to turn, my next option is to hire a civil attorney.

1/21/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I took out a mortgage around 2008 for my house and the land it sits on. Today I still owe about {$130000.00}. At the time of the mortgage I had a different job and made around {$4700.00} a month. I am now a XXXX and make about {$3400.00} a month. My mortgage payment is over {$1100.00}. That means that after taxes and the mortgage I have roughly {$1000.00} a month to live on. Utilities and transportation alone account for almost all of the "" extra ''. I have depleted every penny of savings in the last few years keeping up with my mortgage but I am now unable to afford the payment. I have asked repeatedly to alter the payments in some way XXXX such as extending to 30 years -- the current term is 23 years ). 

It is bad enough that I am unable to make the payments. I feel like a failure for this fact alone. But what is frustrating beyond comprehension is the mortgage company 's employees. Just today I had another in a long line of conversations with a representative who told me that I was squandering money and hiding information. She insisted that I make {$4700.00} a month. She interrogated me like a murder suspect, asking me how much my electricity bill is and relentlessly switching time frames and topics in order to frustrate and confuse. When I gave her information, like my monthly utility costs, she demanded more specificity, a different detail, or simply refuted it. She continually told me that the problem is that "" they '' are unable to figure out how I am spending {$4700.00} every month and that therefore there will be no relief of any kind. 

I am not attempting to get out of paying the full {$130000.00} that I owe, plus interest that accrues. I feel the deepest of obligations to do so, in fact. But the plain truth is that I can not. Circumstances have changed since the mortgage was extended. I am asking for a corresponding adjustment on the mortgage company 's behalf so that I may pay this mortgage for the next two decades. 

But even if that is n't possible, simple human decency is NOT too much to request. I am already subject to the disdain that many have for XXXX. To be frank, I feel that I should n't be punished for taking a XXXX in the poorest county in Virginia ( XXXX ). The house I live in is a double-wide, hardly an over-indulgent mansion I splurged on in a fit of irresponsible greed. It sits on XXXX acres of hilly, rocky land that is n't suitable for any sort of development in a depressed area of the country. And I am not only willing, but desperately want to pay every dime I owe. I simply can not. At least not as the terms currently exist. 

I am asking for a reasonable accommodation so that I may pay in full. My complaint is thus twofold : 1 ) That the mortgage company is so completely rigid that there is no way to reduce a payment that accounts for over 50 % of my take-home pay on a double-wide in economically-stressed XXXX, and 2 ) That the employees, down the line without exception, treat me as if I am a liar and a criminal. If there is no wiggle room, then so be it. My house will be yet another foreclosure. But there is no need to question my integrity and to overtly insult my very character. I wonder how these employees would feel if I treated their kids in a similar manner while they were at school simply trying to obtain an education and better themselves.

8/10/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"To whom this may concern, I would like to raise the issue with respect to wells fargo 's online banking systems and its transaction hold times. I have a suspicion that wells fargo engages in illegal authorization of charges, but not in the order the consumer would have made those charges. And that their online banking systems does not include the most recent Transaction history. In all cases Wells Fargo has blamed the "" Merchant ''. I am finding that charges made using my ELECTRONIC debit card are not posting to my account for almost 3 business days. For example, If I have an available balance of {$100.00} on Friday and swipe my electronic debit card at XXXX for {$10.00}, when I log onto my online banking site ( SAME DAY ) I should have a current balance of {$100.00} and an available balance of {$90.00} as the {$10.00} transaction from XXXX would still have been pending until the next banking update, which usually takes place the next business day. In the past with not only wells Fargo, but other banking institutions that I bank with, That "" XXXX charge could pend for up to 5 days, but most cases it only takes Maximum 2 days. Not with Wells Fargo. When logging on to the online banking site, Their is NO record of my transaction to XXXX, and the charge was not taken from my current balance, thus not allowing my true balance to be reflected. On the following Monday, after I may have spent what my "" online baking '' said I had available to me, from over the weekend I will see that SAME XXXX charge of {$10.00} from Friday show up under the pending transactions and then the bank claimed they paid it and now I am hit with an overdraft fee. This is not legal banking. This can not be legal representation of a consumers accurate account balance. I have trouble believing that the merchant would not even present payment on an account for 3-10 business days after the initial authorization of verifying funds in the account for. These Suspicious and illegal banking practices of random account debits and authorizations, have caused me many fees and Wells Fargo does not seem to take any responsibility for charges they post to a consumers account many days after the initial charge was made. This is n't a check that myself or consumers are using. Its an electronic banking card and the expectation is that it would reflect the most recent account transactions. Even a check deposited posts before some charges that I have made with my electronic debit card.

When I tried to correct, it said you can only do one payment online per day. I then called. When I first got online it asked for account number etc. and social - It paused for a long time and never found my account. Then I called again spoke to an agent who told me it cost {$10.00} to make a payment using her so she will transfer me into the system again. She then transferred me into something that basically put me on hold and never got back to me. Then I called back again trying to make a payment with the automated system on the phone again. At this point, 20+ minutes into this saga, I still can not make this payment. I am now on my XXXX or XXXX attempt to get verified on their IVR - no success to date. So their IVR can not authenticate me, the agent wants {$10.00} to do it with a human, the website wo n't let me fix the issue. 

This is clearly a UDAAP issueI believe this is purposely made difficult for customers to ring up fees and late charges.

9/8/2015,Bank account or service,Savings account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"I opened a checking account and a 0.99 % interest savings account with Ally Bank because they said their savings compounded daily. I received an email from them that I had been verified, which means my information checks out and they took money out of my personal checking account to fund the XXXX accounts I had opened with Ally Bank. I also sent a email to them using their own site asking them if they could change my mailing address to a XXXX Box I 'm renting and gave them the info for that. Then they blocked my account. I called them and they said my accounts were considered fraudulent and I had to send them more information. They gave me the number of someone who works in their loss prevention department named XXXX over in Texas. I called him twice and left a message XXXX times and nothing has come from that. His number is XXXX. I have sent an email to Ally Bank through their website expressing my disappointment with how their Bank does business. I called before XXXX holiday and talked with another person from Ally Bank and told them I had reported Ally Bank to the Federal Trade Commission and the resolution I want is my money back and for my accounts with Ally to be cancelled and they better not have done a credit check on me. It is now XXXX XXXX, the day after XXXX XXXX. I called again just now and talked to someone on Ally Bank and gave them all of my info again ( I do this every time I call ) but they still wo n't unblock my account and this time I got hung up on probably when the guy put me on hold he did it wrong. Or perhaps they just want to rub it in. Basically I thought I was getting a good deal because my personal savings account offers 0.10 % interest rate but Ally Bank verified me, took my money, and then declared me fraudulent. So how do I get my money back??? I already passed their verification test and they sent me an email saying they were sending me a signature card to sign in the mail. So if they could in fact not verify me why did they transfer the money? Now they wo n't give it back. They ca n't operate this way. My financial institution where my personal checking and savings are with has agreed to dispute the transfers to Ally Bank so I 'll be going in later to fill out paper work. Also when filling out the online application for Ally Bank after ward it asked me questions about my credit report. That was weird. I was never told at any time during the application process my credit would be checked. I asked a person when I called Ally Bank but they did n't answer my question. If Ally Bank did check my credit without telling me I will be unhappy about that and they need to take that off my credit reports if they did and put a statement on their website that says they check credit reports when signing up. I signed up with a different online account just for savings a few months ago and that online savings account does not do not do credit checks of applicants so I was expecting the same thing from Ally Bank as they have no statement about credit being checked when applying for any accounts. Also on XXXX, yesterday, I received an email from Ally Bank saying I have a secure message from them and to sign into my account. I ca n't I tried again but because they believe my account to be fraudulent and they want me to prove I am who I am. If they believe my account to be fraudulent then why are they sending emails to me to log into my account? Something is not right, Ally Bank is screwing with my personal info and my money. After typing up this report I tried to sign in again with Ally Bank and my account is still blocked. So I 'm figuring the guy I talked to 56 minutes ago really did hang up on me on purpose. All of this nonsense for a total of {$20.00}? Really? That 's how much I setup to be transferred in total to Ally Bank.

When I submitted my information I was then told I do not qualify for the Discover Card I applied for and a XXXX card offer was made. This XXXX offer of lower interest ( BASED ON MY CREDIT SCORE ) was used a BAIT to get me to fill out the paperwork. Once I completed the paperwork another page popped up asking me to send copies of personal data such as SSN and or Current bills. I was not comfortable providing this information largely since the app did not work and all other credit cards I have can provide approval in XXXX seconds based on information contained in my XXXX XXXX. I called Discover Card and asked them if they were the actual Credit Card or was this scam, the whole thing was a bit fishy. I learned the Discover Card had no idea that they are soliciting new customers using bait and switch tactics on Credit Karma "" indicating they do not communicate internally ''. I demanded that this process be cancelled and my credit hit be removed to protect my score. Today I get an email indicating the account was still being processed against my will. I called and spoke to XXXX Senior Agent in Delaware at phone number XXXX regarding application XXXX. I also demanded that she terminate the application and remove the credit hit sine this whole process was unfair and dirty BAIT AND SWITCH tactics. I told her I do not need the card with HIGHER INTEREST and I will not tolerate this treatment.

8/31/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I filed a complaint on this site in XXXX about the problems with misapplied mortgage payments and FALSE CLAIMS against HUD by Citimortgage. I told you about the electrical problems and outdoor electrical wires hanging off of the buildings, buildings being off of their foundations etc. I want you to know that I wrote Senator XXXX XXXX and President Obama about the HUD/FHA. XXXX times I wrote about this situation and each time the Director of HUD would write to the President and Sen. XXXX that they would love to assist me but I do not have an FHA loan. I sent copies of my mortgage statement, to show that the loan is FHA, and they still told me other wise. There are too many major things wrong with the way things are on my property and loan. On XXXX XXXX, of XXXX Citimortgage held a trustee sale on my property and never sent notice to me concerning the sale. I had just sent a payment of {$2200.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I know that Citimortgage never held the note from Home Mortgage Loan Company, and therefore had no assignment of note. Citimortgage sent a man to change the locks on my door in late XXXX XXXX, and that is how I found out about the illegal trustee sale. For a year and four months Citimortgage did not contact me. I just found out that Citimortgage changed my mailing address to some post office box and only sent mail there. I do not have a post office box. On the answer to my complaint Citimortgage said that they needed more time. I had told the President and Senator about all the unsafe conditions that my property was sold to me under. A year after the close of escrow XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had an arrest warrant issued for my arrest due to the conditions that this FHA loan approved property was in. Citimortgage did not have a deed in my name from the close of escrow until late in the year of XXXX. There was no certificate of occupancy issued on my property in XXXX. The certificate was not issued until XXXX and then it was issued to a XXXX XXXX XXXX. To get this certificate XXXX XXXX had to show a valid deed in his name. 
Citimortgage constantly placed mortgage payments made by me into an account other than my account and would then refuse to find the money and place it for my credit. I later found that Citimortgage has XXXX accounts where they were placing the majority of my payments in a XXXX account with an ending number XXXX digit higher than my primary account number. They would then force me into foreclosure and default that was not even valid. All of this trouble while making major repairs to a property that never passed even a code inspection. 
In XXXX of XXXX Citimortgage vendors along with the police began a campaign of harassment and threats against me and my family. The vendor would walk into my home without knocking and threaten to take my entire family including my XXXX daughter who uses a XXXX to jail. It was under these conditions that Citimortgage coerced me out of my home. 
My loan with Citimortgage is still active and valid and my HUD account is still active and valid, my property insurance is active and valid and in my name. Citimortgage is criminallyguilty of extrinsic fraud, extortion, and stealing XXXX my dollars and making false claims against HUD. The threats of harm to me and my family that came from the vendors for Citimortgage and attorneys are also criminal. Because of the way my HUD account was constantly denied and the vendors for Citimorgage were above the law I wanted to protect my XXXX daughter and not be shot dead or tossed in the street tunaware. Citimortgage used a very aggressive police hand in getting my XXXX family out of my house and getting me the sign lies against the court system for fear of their power to even control the Department of Housing and Urban Developmen

5/1/2016,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"1. The first complaint that I have is that I requested a loan modification XX/XX/2015 because I was unable to make my payments at the current rate and I was approved. I followed everything I was supposed to do according to the verbal conversation I had with the representative. After I mailed the 4th payment I received a letter telling me the loan mod was cancelled because I had not sent back the paperwork. I called and asked what paperwork they said the modification agreement. When I requested them to send it back out so I could sign it, their response was no we will not send the paperwork again, we are returning the last ( 4th ) payment made and to not make any other payments at the modification amount, and to contact a HUD agent. 
2. After working with a HUD agent for the last 6 months, we have been offered a new loan modification agreement. This modification agreement has worse terms that the last one. Examples of these terms are the interest rate and the length of the modification. 
A. I was told the 11.9 % interest rate would go to 5.57 % for 5 years and then would increase by 1 % until it reached the cap, which is current market interest rate. This was in the preliminary loan mod paperwork. Which my HUD agent and I called to get verification on so we could make an informed decision before sending in the {$1500.00} payment required to start the modification process. However when I received the paperwork to sign and send it back it said the rate was 6.232 % and after the 24 months it would go up it would back to the 11.9 % interest rate. 
B. This new modification is for only 24 months not a permanent resolution to the problem. The last loan mod was a permanent fixed modification. 
3. The new loan modification paperwork I have received says that the balloon payment is no longer required but is unclear if it will come due at the end of the 24 month modification or the end of the loan or if it completely gone. All of these answers have been given to us by several "" mortgaging specialists '' at HSBC when we have called to get clarification and none of these answer are put into writing give confirmation of what answer is the correct answer. 
4. Deferred Interest : In the modification agreement I received it claims over XXXX dollars in deferred interest. When asked about this we were not given answer on who authorized and agreed to this. I was told on the Phone with my HUD agent present the last deferment was made in XXXX 2015, which I had no knowledge of, did not ask for at the time, and was not notified of the deferment. HSBC took it upon themselves to do what they wanted without consulting or notifying me about this. 
5. Then all on the same day, my HUD agent was notified I was approved for the loan modification, I was sent the preliminary paper stating that I need to mail the XXXX payment to start the modification process, and they filed for foreclosure.",,HSBC North America Holdings Inc.,IN,467XX,,Consent provided,Web,5/1/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,1904412

I call the number and leave messages that I am not the individual they are trying to contact and that no one lives there by that name. I ask for a call back. Now, the voice mail box is full and not accepting any calls. Literally these calls are in the hundreds now and quite frustrating since I owe no one anything.

The bank account pulls money from my checking account but then holds the money for over a week. I want to say the funds were held for 7-10 days. That 's fine if it was a check but this is an EFT transfer. So, I 'm losing the money out of my bank and not able to use it to pay my loan. So, In the meantime I look at my loan and pay the bill but the payment gets returned because the funds that they pulled electronically are n't available yet. Ok fine that does n't seem right but whatever. So, I paid 2 months on the loan and it should be due again in XXXX. I get online and verify this. Then today I find that the loan payment pulls monthly even if it 's not due. So, the site a few days ago says the payment is due in XXXX. I look at the next payment and that says XXXX and yet the payment gets pulled for XXXX anyway. So now I 'm overdrawn on the bank account will pay a fee for the return on the loan as well as an overdraft on the bank account. Then they 'll pull the money from my checking account. Hold it for 7 plus days and take fees out of it. So, when it 's time to pay XXXX bill it will be short and I 'll have to send more money that will get held and have fees taken out of. So, it 's this vicious cycle that you ca n't get out of. They should n't hold a deposit that they pulled eft out of my bank account for that long. They need to give better info on when payments are being pulled and they should n't say a payments not due and still pull it. It all ends up costing the consumer a lot in fees. After the last time this happened I thought I was planning ahead and getting the money into the "" bank '' account a month early was enough time. It is n't. I 'm out fees again. Does n't seem right.

When I called them at their customer service number they said that the transfer limit maximum was {$1000.00} at most. I told them I never would have applied if the online application had indicated that. The CSR apologized and asked if I had any other questions. I told him I felt the online application was used as a tool to lure new card members and that I never would have applied if they had indicated the maximum transfer amount.

I called them in XX/XX/XXXX to request a XXXX fixed mortgage since the principle of my loan was {$50000.00} and it never decreased after paying 10 years. I was denied a modification because I had never missed a payment. I thought that was crazy so I resubmitted it. They began returning my payments which forced me to miss payments. I was so frustrated with calling there and being talked to like an XXXX I hired XXXX XXXX to help me. XXXX was able to work out a modification where I was in a 30 year fixed but they hurt my credit with the missed payments! I was now back to paying 30 years of interest as if I never paid the 10 years. I made my payments every month on time for 10 months then they sent me a statement with an additional {$110.00} charge added to my mortgage payment. I called and was told to fax in my problem and to send in my normal payment. I sent in my payment less the {$110.00} charge. I received a letter stating the {$110.00} was an error and would be corrected. When I received my statement for the next month they had not applied my payment, it was sitting in unapplied funds and they were requesting double the amount that I owe monthly. I called and was told my payment was not paid in full so it would not be applied. I explained that I did make my normal payment as instructed to do so but not the {$110.00} that was put on my account in error. So once again I only paid my normal payment for the month. This went on for 3 months. I thought their system would finally see I was not behind in my payments because the money was sitting there in unapplied funds but no such luck. I called in XXXX and they told me that since this all happened in XX/XX/XXXX there is nothing they can do. So I have a mortgage payment sitting in unapplied funds that will never be applied to my mortgage because they overcharged me {$110.00}. When I called in XXXX I was told I was 3 months behind when I have NEVER missed a payment. My statement shows I owe them over {$1500.00}. In XXXX I decided not to pay them to see if they would apply the mortgage payment that is sitting in unapplied funds. I feel they want to force me into a foreclosure. Since I just do n't have the money to hire XXXX again, I had just given up until an agency called XXXX XXXX suggested I contact your agency.

On XX/XX/XXXX I went to a tire company for new tires in the amount of XXXX. I handed the sales representative my CarCare One card which is managed by Synchrony Bank and my card was declined. The sales representative asked permission to contact the card company to verify the card was still active. He contacted the company and was told my available balance was XXXX. I was stunned because the balance was paid in full XX/XX/XXXX which means I would have a XXXX line of credit. I called my husband and asked him to go online and check the account to verify it was paid in full and it was. Because the repair was more than the available credit I had to pay out of pocket. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Synchrony with the number the tire company provided me at XXXX and spoke with a rep by the name of XXXX to inquire about my line of credit considering the card was paid in full. He informed me my available credit was XXXX and that they do show the payment I made on XXXX and I have a current balance due of XXXX. I asked him why was my entire line of XXXX available, he told me there is a 7-10 business hold on payments XXXX or more for security reasons. I told him I know they received the payment because they received it within 48 hours of me making it online and if it was going to be returned it would have been returned already. I then asked where in my statements or even on their website does it notify me the customer/consumer there will be a hold on my line of credit because I made a XXXX or more credit. He told me to hold for a 1 or 2 minutes and then the phone hung up. I called back again but at the number on my statement XXXX and spoke to another gentlemen ( XXXX I think ). I told him I just spoke to a guy named XXXX about the issue regarding my line of credit and told him the issue. He said the same thing about the 7-10 business day hold on payments of XXXX or more and it was for security purposes. I told him I did n't care about the security reason, I 'm calling to inquire about the lack of notification regarding the hold on my line of credit. He kept telling me for security reasons it will take 7-10 business days and if I wait to Friday I can use the full credit amount. I told him, he was n't listening to my question, my question was not about security but about notification and why was I not notified as the customer/consumer about this hold. He told me the 7-10 business day thing again and I told him I know he was reading from a script and I do n't care about the script but the fact I did n't know about the hold and I had to come out of pocket for something I did n't want to come out of pocket for and they inconvenienced me by not notifying me of the hold. I told him I need to speak to someone higher up and he said he can transfer me to his supervisor but they are going to tell me the exact same thing, I told him I know he was and that 's why I am going to go a different route. I filed a complaint with the XXXX and the case number is XXXX. The company stated the notification was in my terms and conditions disclosure. I have reviewed the disclosure and still find there is lack of disclosure pertaining credit availability. Synchrony states they "" may '' delay making credit available but still does not inform the consumer the "" may '' could result in a 7-10 day business day hold. Also, there is nothing in the disclosure that states additional steps must be taken for me to "" restore '' my available credit "" prior to the normal time frame.

I disputed the debt directly with XXXX and XXXX received that notification from me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX where I asked for documents needed for debt validation from this collection agency. My initial notice was ignored. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX received a second notice from me informing them that they violated the FCRA, the FDCPA, and the TEXAS FDCPA by leaving this UNVALIDATED account on my credit report as the TEXAS FDCPA states a collection agency has 30 days from their receipt of a consumers DISPUTE and validation request in which to provide the items needed to vakidate the debt to the consumer, if the collection agency neglects to provide the consumer with the items necessary to validate the debt as the consumers within 30 days then the collection agency must remove the debt from the consumers credit report with all credit bureaus within 5 days. I demanded the immediate removal of this collection account that is not mine from all credit reports as per law or I would pursue the max compensation that I am entitled to under the FDCPA, the FCRA, and the TX FDCPA which is actionable under the TX DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE ACT AND AWARDS triple the amount in addition to mental anguish awards. XXXX IGNORED MY SECOND NOTIFICATION. ON XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX received a demand for restitution document and notice of my intent to prosecute my claim against them in federal and state courts for XXXX DELIBERATE VIOLATIONS OF MY RIGHTS UNDER THE FCRA, THE FDCPA AND THE TEXAS FDCPA. THAT DOCUMENT GAVE XXXX 60 days to reach a settlement with me or my attorney will proceed in a suit against this collection agency in Federal and State court for AMRs deliberate violations of my rights under the FCRA, the FDCPA, and the Texas Fdcpa by reporting this unvalidated account on my credit reports, neglecting to notify the credit bureaus that this account was disputed by consumer on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, deliberately reporting false information on my credit report among other violations. This demand for restitution and payment of damages document which XXXX received via certified mail on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX served to meet the requirements under the TX DTPA which states that a formal notice must be given to the defendant granting them 60 days to reach a settlement with the plaintiff prior to proceeding to court. I had disputed this item with all XXXX credit bureaus and since XXXX neglected to validate the debt within 30 days of my written request and since XXXX could not verify the debt to them XXXX was smart enough to follow the federal and state credit acts which states that credit bureaus can not report an account that a collection agency failed to validate to the consumer within 30 days of the consumers written request on an individual 's credit report. XXXX and Experian, however, chose to verify this account that XXXX failed to validate as mine. XXXX violated my rights under the FCRA, the FDCPA, and the Texas Fdcpa by verifying this account to the credit bureaus when XXXX KNEW THAT XXXX NEGLECTED TO VALIDATE THIS DEBT TO ME AS PER THE WRITTEN REQUEST THAT XXXX RECEIVED FROM ME ON XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Now XXXX and Experian have violated my rights under the FDCPA, FCRA, AND THE TEXAS FDCPA BY VERIFYING THIS ACCOUNT AS ACCURATE AND MINE WHEN NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

8/19/2015,Debt collection,I do not know,Improper contact or sharing of info,Contacted me after I asked not to,"This complaint is concerning collection calls by First Horizon/First Tennessee Bank regarding a HELOC ( Home Equity Line of Credit ). We thought this was a mortgage loan ; however, we are being told that it is treated as a credit card debt. 

In a previous CFPB complaint dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, we explained that we have only Social Security as income as a result of layoffs. We applied for this HELOC, in good faith, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We 'Paid as agreed ' until XXXX, XXXX, after we had been unsuccessful in finding new employment after layoff ; we notified First Horizon/First Tennessee that we would attempt to sell the property. 

We received an email from their Consumer Loan Servicing Department, with text highlighted in bright yellow, saying, "" The offer must net a minimum of 40 % -60 % of our mortgages current principal balance to be considered. '' Our Realtor said that the real estate market could not meet that requirement. 

Our credit report indicates that this HELOC was 'charged off ' by First Horizon XXXX yet, they continue to call. I notified them in writing that we are seniors with only Social Security as income. It was explained that we could not afford to pay off this loan, so why keep calling? Their written response says that they have the right to continue calling in an effort to collect. 

I have a log of their phone calls from XXXX XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX which include calls on weekends and a call on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. As their letter stated, they are within their rights to attempt to collect. Nevertheless, our income has not changed and we are seniors. When we lost employment, several loans were placed in default ; however, First Horizon is the only one still calling. Is it not enough that these loans appear as defaults on our credit report? There is no justification for these calls, and it begs the question as to whether all of the Social Security seniors who are in default receive collection calls, or is it only select ones? The loan has been charged off, we have no earned income, and we request that the calls stop.

I recently had to pay {$360.00} to Wells Fargo for them to perform an appraisal of my property ( XXXX, CO ) for PMI purposes. A full appraisal was performed on XXXX/XXXX/15 and I received a copy of the final appraisal report on XXXX/XXXX/15. On XXXX/XXXX/15 Wells Fargo called me to confirm I received the appraisal report, then at that time we discussed potentially refinancing my loan given recent rate activity. The mortgage consultant I dealt with ( XXXX ) mentioned that an appraisal would be necessary for the refinance and then confirmed via email that I COULD NOT use the XXXX I just bought through them for {$360.00}. 

This appraisal is less than 30 days old, it was purchased through them, and I just paid {$360.00} for it - yet now they are telling me it is not valid and I need to turn around and re-purchase the exact same thing from them again in order to refinance my loan. This is predatory behavior and Wells Fargo is trying to take advantage of its customers.

Finally, after 9 months they agreed that it could be done in XXXX installments. At that point, I had a XXXX and told them that I could not do it. XXXX XXXX agreed to tear the whole roof off and replace slate with tile. that needed to go through the Historical Society. Someone fixed the roof and I asked if I could be paid because I fixed the ceiling. I was told to submit the request, later to be told no because I was in bankruptcy. XXXX another storm hits and the insurance company told me that I needed to prove that the first claim was fixed. Therefore, I could not remember and went through the phone book. Later my insurance agent told me the reason why I did not know who fixed the ceiling was because Wells Fargo had it fixed. That they had requested a list of contractors stating that I was incompetent. My insurance agent said XXXX you would have had to sign the check. I told her that I had never seen a check. Therefore, I called Wells Fargo at least XXXX times always to be told that someone was going to do research and get back with me. XXXX person did I missed his call and called him back without any response. I have told Wells Fargo repeatedly that it is raining in my home ; XXXX ceilings have come down in the bedrooms.

They received the check XXXX XXXX, XXXX signed my name XXXX XXXX, XXXX and sent a check drawn on Wells Fargo to the Bankruptcy Court in the Trustees name who in turn paid them as creditors. The sad thing is that all this time they worded our conversations as if the insurance check was sent to the Trustees. Wells Fargo did not send the insurance check to the Trustees. This week I sent the copy of the check to the trustees and was informed that they had never seen the check and provided me with a copy of the one send to them. Now my house still 2 years later is unlivable. Also the insurance did give me a check to fix the carriage house but Wells Fargo place an insurance deductible of XXXX.

Myself and classmates whom attended XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) acknowledge and agree, they 've defrauded on multiple counts that include : 1. XXXX of XXXX falsely represented its academic programs as a good investment despite the fact that it knew that the default rate on student loans for its graduates within three ( 3 ) years of graduation may be well up to XXXX % ; and despite the fact that the loan payments students were saddled with prohibits students from being able to live financially independent. 
2. XXXX of XXXX falsely represented to ( your name ) and his fellow Classmates that they could expect to work at some of the biggest and best companies in the world with their degrees from XXXX of XXXX. 
3. XXXX of XXXX knew that many of the businesses hiring in the field of XXXX XXXX would not interview or hire XXXX graduates because of their poor reputation. 
4. XXXX of XXXX hired alumni who could not find jobs and taught as professors or teachers ; having no real world experience or any certifications or history of teaching. 
5. Many of these instructors admitted to the Plaintiffs that they did not have the experience or the knowledge to teach the courses they were teaching. 
6. Myself fellow Classmates independently searched for required internships and externships that many times had no relation to their respective fields of study. 
7. Myself and fellow Classmates who eventually did graduate from XXXX, soon found out that their degrees were not worth the financial investment they 've made and rather nominal or less than nominal value to prospective employers hiring in their field of study. 
8. Contrary to XXXX 's quota driven salespeople 's representations, at all relevant times, XXXX had a poor reputation in the XXXX industry. 
9. To keep enrollments up, and receive more tuition payments, teachers and professors at XXXX were pressured to pass students who did not attend classes, did not complete their coursework, or were not achieving passing grades. 
10. XXXX 's quota-driven admissions representatives, pursuant to their policies, were directed to methodically avoid discussing the true facts and figures with prospective students.

11. XXXX 's of XXXX Career Services department was staffed by unqualified individuals. The Career Services Department consisted of XXXX person, who was also a student at XXXX, who did little more than direct graduates to websites with job listings that they could find themselves, such as XXXX or XXXX, or provide compilations of such listings mined from such websites. Moreover, many of the listings provided to Class members had no relation to their respective fields of study. 
Many Class members, upon finding out about the inadequacies of an education from XXXX, the degrees were essentially worthless in which decided to obtain degrees from other educational institutions. However, many educational institutions policies do n't accept credits/degree 's from Nationally Accredited institutions and Class members were forced to either not attend school.

This is a debt collection Agency who refuses to give me a physical address. Instead, all they gave me was a XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Their tactics have included : falsely identifying themselves as a lawyers office or a mediation firm. Additionally, they have threatened arrest and stated that someone from the Sherriff 's office would be coming by to arrest at XXXX. 
Additionally, they have restated back personal information to identify that they know "" what car you drive '', etc. 
Additionally, they have spoken with other members about the debt other than an immediate spouse. 
I have today filed a CEASE and DESIST letter with the agency. 
I have today spoken to the original debtor -TD Bank XXXX who apparently sold the debt to another company and who apparently sold the debt to NCR XXXX Niagra Capital Recovery XXXX. They state that they have begun to have complaints about this company and asked me to send them a copy of the Cease and Desist letter. 
The original debt was about {$150.00}. NCR has asked as much as over {$1000.00} or threatened arrest. 
These people need to be shut down. 
I have contacted an attorney on a cursory level who informed me to submit a cease and desist letter.

There 's got to be some type of law that protects families from Going through this chaos, of waiting and waiting. I feel its neglect, and home buyers and sellers suffer because of the process that underwriters are given to undertake. They are neglecting time frames, questioning documentation that they are not trained to question. I can tell you if you dig deep enough you will find bad in everyone. No one is perfect and the digging and investigation has to stop somewhere. It 's as if the Mortgage Industry, IRS, and the FBI have merged together to create a process that does n't work.

7/15/2016,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Having problems with customer service,"XX/XX/XXXX, we applied for a tuition loan to help pay for our son 's college tuition. The loan was through XXXX XXXX and was a Federal Plus Loan. After 1 year, we decided to pay off the loan, as the interest rate was insane. XXXX XXXX, the loan was paid in full. About XXXX XXXX, we started getting phone calls about an outstanding student loan from Navient. Never having heard of the company, and knowing the student loan was paid off, we thought the calls were a scam. After a year of receiving these phone calls, I decided to confront the callers with the documents showing the loan was paid in full. A month of phone calls later, and many conversations with different entities/companies, of which I never got the same person twice, I find out that there was an additional "" student loan '' that gave {$3500.00} DIRECTLY to our son, via XXXX checks from XXXX XXXX. He thought that was all the loan we qualified for, so he cashed the checks and used them for books, lab fees and living ( food, dorm charges ) expenses. No one told us he received the money, and it was not included in the pay off amount we received when we wanted the payoff amount. He graduated in XX/XX/XXXX, and then the collection calls begin, to OUR home, not his. It appears the Parent Plus loan we received also gave a chunk of money to the student to do with what he pleased -- never indicating to the parents that the student was getting cash. Once our son graduated, the loan required payments be made ; but for 8 years accrued interest, with NO ONE INFORMING US THERE WAS A LOAN OUTSTANDING. We were under the belief that we paid the loan in full. The loan began with XXXX XXXX who, XX/XX/XXXX, decided to get out of the federal loan business, and returned the loan to the Department of Ed. They, in turn, sent it off to XXXX (? ), who I still ca n't identify ... .who, in XX/XX/XXXX, sold it to Navient. All this transpired WITH NO COMMUNICATION TO EITHER OUR SON OR US, ABOUT ANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS OR OUTSTANDING DEBIT OWED! The original paper work we completed has our current address on it and we have not moved in 26 years. Our son lived in the dorm for 2 years, then moved to a house for 6 and never received any notification of an outstanding loan. No wonder student loans are never paid off -- the students do n't even know they exist! AND, who is going to stop the vicious cycle because there is interest being accrued on the loan amount? Why would any company want the loan paid off early, and receive less money? I have since paid the loan off, and hope that other parents do not fall into the same dark hole we did, not knowing that the tuition loans the parents applied for, can give money DIRECTLY to a college student without the parents knowing, and place the students in a ridiculous amount of debt before they even earn their degree! I still can not believe no one, at anytime, from any company, tried to contact us regarding this loan! In addition, on one phone call to Navient, I wanted to make a payment to show good faith. A rather large payment. I was told, since the loan was in 'default, ' they could not take the amount I wanted to pay, but could only accept the amount that was 'back owed ' ( or the outstanding interest ) for the past year. I paid that amount, but again, the loan accrued interest based on the remaining balance owed -- which would have been about half, IF they would have accepted the amount I wanted to pay. Again, the company gains more money via interest accruing, because of the larger, outstanding balance!",,"Navient Solutions, Inc.",AZ,853XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/18/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,2014409

We clearly stated our intentions to close all accounts and move on from this bank. After a half hour or so, we had exchanged cash where applicable in order to zero out each of our XXXX accounts. The banker told us we were completely closed out. We left the branch that day under the impression all accounts were closed per our discussion with the bank rep whose name is XXXX. A few weeks later we discover my wife 's "" overdraft line of credit '' was in fact left open ( against our wishes ) and was now showing a negative balance of XXXX {$60.00}. The banker only actually closed XXXX out of XXXX of our accounts ( left my wife 's "" overdraft protection '' line of credit open, even though the checking account it was linked to was closed ). So we immediately call the branch and we 're initially told its not possible to close the line of credit without coming into the branch. My wife explained to the rep its extremely difficult for us to come to this branch as its not close to our residence. Finally the rep says she will close the account and mail us a bill for the remaining balance on the account ( telling us that they waived a late fee ). 3 weeks go by and we do n't receive anything so we call again. This time we speak with a third rep who tells my wife to mail in a check for XXXX {$30.00} which will close out the account and we 're assured the account will actually be closed this time. We leave for a one-week vacation and when we return theres a letter from M & T Bank which is dated 3 days before our previous phone call and states that there 's an overdue balance of {$1.00} which at this point is 50 days past due and that this has been reported to credit bureaus. Sure enough we check my wife 's credit report and now see XXXX delinquent account on her report. This is the first and only delinquency on her credit report and her score has already dropped by XXXX points. We 've spoken with the branch manager named XXXX who is currently researching the issue has told us he 's not exactly sure if this is the bank 's fault and can not promise a reversal of the negative reporting to the credit bureaus. We firmly believe if the first banker ( XXXX ) had simply closed the overdraft line of credit the first time we visited the branch ( as we had asked for and assumed had happened ) there would be no issue and nothing negative to report to the credit bureaus.",,M&T Bank Corporation,NY,112XX,,Consent provided,Web,5/6/2016,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,1907199

4/1/2016,Credit card,,Billing statement,,"We have a credit card with Discover. We make our minimum payments on time and as a way to pay down our balance sooner, we have been making extra payments. Typically these extra payments were being made on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. The amounts of these extra payments were anywhere from {$5.00} - {$50.00}. We made a payment of {$350.00} recently. That amount covered what I used to purchase things plus extra. Upon checking my account, I noticed that our balance had increased instead of decreasing, so I called. I was told that according to my user agreement, Discover confiscates extra payments and applies them to the minimum balance of the following month due to how 'our billing cycle ' is set up. I called again, got the same answer. I emailed them, and again, they insist that they are going to confiscate these extra payments unless they are paid before the XXXX of each month. Today ( XXXX XXXX ) I called the exec office of Discover. The first person I spoke with hung up on me and the second person gave me the same story about how we agreed to all of this and it has always been that way. Since I do not have a copy of the 2011 Discover user agreement, I ca n't honestly say whether it has 'always been this way ' or not. Basically what Discover is saying is that none of their card holders can be trusted to pay their bills even if Discover has not justifiable reason for treating their customers this way including us. I have read all of Discover 's disclosure pages posted here as well their website and even checked the Federal Reserve 's disclosure page. None of these pages explain this confiscation policy that Discover talks about. If this what users are agreeing to, why is this not posted on their website? People should know how ( or in this case IF ) their money is being applied to their balance. right? 

In order to make these extra payments work as intended, a customer has to XXXX of XXXX things. A ) Pay the extra within the window that it wo n't be confiscated or B ) Pay extra on their minimum payment. Option A pays down balance. Option B may or may not pay down a balance depending on how much is paid. The only way to decrease the balance with Option B would be to pay the minimum plus the interest, plus whatever the extra would be. 

Since Discover is so concerned with minimum payments being made, one would be lead to believe that they would appreciate any extra money that was sent their way. That seems not to be the case. Instead, if a card holder does not know about this confiscation policy, they make not progress paying off their balance if they make the minimum payment with no extra. Sounds like a good money making deal for Discover if I 've ever heard one. 

I have a copy of the Discover user agreement being sent to me. According to their website it will take XXXX30 days to get here. Not that it matters at this point as now I know what the game is. Pay extra in the 5 day window along with the regular minimum payment plus interest. 

I do n't expect anything to become of this complaint, but I do think Discover customers who do pay their bills and send extra payments should know what they are getting into. As mentioned previously, since Discover feels that strongly about this policy, it should be posted in all of their disclosure pages and on their page that explains how payments are applied which includes the extra ones. If they do n't want to post it there, it should be printed on billing statements as there is no mention of this policy there either. All it mentions is paying down higher interest rate balances first. No mention of confiscation of extra payments..

2/22/2016,Credit reporting,,Credit monitoring or identity protection,Problem with fraud alerts,"I somehow have a fraud alert on my Experian credit report. I can not get it removed and now I am unable to be on our mortgage bc my mortgage company ca n't pull my Experian report bc of this fraud alert. My interest rate is also going up almost XXXX points bc I am unable to be on the mortgage. Mortgage company has no problems pulling the others reports w the other bureaus. 
Over the last 6 weeks -- -I have called 3 times, submitted 4 faxes, mailed a letter AND uploaded a document via Experian upload. AND THE FRAUD ALERT IS STILL THERE. 
Every time I called it was VERY difficult to get the person I spoke to to understand my problem, and the canned response was to send me to their website for help. The first phone call resolved that my address was the problem -- - not the fraud alert -- -- so I submitted a form for that. The second phone call could n't confirm that I had a fraud alert I was told that I had to pay {$10.00} ( which I did ) to get a copy of my report to verify that I did indeed have a fraud alert on my account. The next call directs me again to the Experian website -- - website said "" we are unable to find you in the system '' -- - I had to call AGAIN to still not have any resolution. 
Mortgage companies and the credit bureaus are giant jerks who take advantage of good people. So now I am having to pay a higher mortgage interest rate bc I ca n't be on the loan. AND i ca n't get the fraud alert off my account AND NO ONE WILL HELP ME!

We have been ON XXXX & XXXX & on our monthly payment for 11 months and are still current as I write this complaint/statement. For some reason since about XXXX of XXXX, we have been getting "" collection calls '' EVERY month. XXXX is going in with this company? Did they get a new head of the AR department, that sees it fit to "" harass '' their customers? They answer the phone with the standard statement "" this is an attempt to collect a debt, any info will be used for that purpose ''. What a GREAT customer service approach!!! Again I have had a half dozen mortgage loans & NEVER have been late & NEVER had this kind of service or better description, HARASSMENT! I have to go to my account EVERY month & make sure that all my deposits were made, as ell as my online bills posted. I have had my account compromised more than one time by the online thieves. So needless to say this cause unnecessary STRESS, when I get a "" collection '' call, for a mortgage that is & always has been CURRENT! I asked the CS gal if they would call me for the next 30 years, EVERY month, if not paid on the XXXX, ( which they give you until the XXXX each month to pay ) she said yes probably, but I could set up auto-pay to avoid their calls. I had to remove my husbands phone number from the database as they were calling him at WORK! Talk about unneeded added STRESS! I have had been hung up on in previous months, because the rep who answered the phone when I returned the call did not have XXXX as his first language & he could not understand me. On another occasion, the "" collection person '' who left me a message did not hang up her phone after leaving the message, so I got a 45 minute voice mail. This is the worst CS I have ever received, only second to XXXX XXXX XXXX who is rumored to be going out of business here. What upsets me even MORE is the fact these companies who loan us money or offer services OWN us through the credit bureaus. They can report anything they want ( as they PAY, and are the credit bureaus CUSTOMER ) and there is NO real verification process. Then our credit worthiness is determined by a FLAWED system/number AND the XXXX NEVER match. Because the harassment policy of XXXX, I will NOT be recommending them to anyone! If they do NOT CHANGE this harassment "" collections '' policy to STOP stressing good customers, I will be reporting them further & I WILL change my phone number with them.

5/5/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"On XXXX XXXX, 2016 and again on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I attempted to open a new, personal CitiGold Interest Checking account. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 their telephone representative told me that my application was accepted and emailed to me a signature card, which I signed and faxed back to them on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Approximately 10 days later, I received by U. S. mail my first Citigold checking account statement, which showed my new account number and account balance. Then XX/XX/2016, I received their letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 stating that they did not open this account, claiming they were unable to verify information. 

Upon phoning them again, they refused to provide any information about what information about me they were unable to verify. They claimed my account was now closed. All representatives I talked to were completely uncooperative and entirely unhelpful about what I could do going forward to re-open this simple checking account. Note that I have been a Citibank credit card customer in good standing for over 10 years, so their bank does have extensive information about me. Also, I was not applying for any form of credit from Citibank. Instead, I was attempting to deposit my money into their bank. 

When originally opening this account, I told them that I was applying using Promotion Code = XXXX, which would allow me to receive a {$500.00} cash bonus if I met certain requirements of the promotion. It became clear in talking with their phone representatives that they were trying to not open this account to avoid eventually paying me this {$500.00} bonus. 

Their offering this new account opening bonus promotion and then refusing to actually open the account constitutes consumer financial fraud, deceptive marketing practices, and sales misrepresentation. I am requesting that ( 1 ) Citibank re-open my checking account under the terms of the original {$500.00} cash bonus promotion, and ( 2 ) the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate Citibank 's many marketing promotions for all other instances of misrepresentation, fraud, and marketing deception.

I recently pulled my credit and it states that this information can not be disputed again due to a fair credit act etc, So they continue to place this off and on my credit over the years and spouse. The report shows I owe {$290.00} and that its unpaid, But As you can see in the letter and I verified again with both the Attorney General and XXXX County via phone as recent as of yesterday XX/XX/XXXX that this was paid and released in XX/XX/XXXX and I was told that it should not be on my credit at all unless showing that is was paid and no longer then 7 years which would have been no later then XX/XX/XXXX.

7/16/2015,Mortgage,Other mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"Please accept this as a formal complaint against Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC for failure to abide by RESPA guidelines. It is unfair and deceptive practice of OCWEN to request all necessary the information for their investigation and to still have our compliant as an unresolved matter. The original submission of our complaint to Ocwen was on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and Ocwen made the first day of the investigation, effective XX/XX/XXXX once it was taken over by a different department, Office of Consumer Ombudsman at Ocwen. It has now taken XXXX days and the issue is still unresolved. Under RESPA, an institution may be granted a XXXX day extension following the expiration of the first XXXX days after receiving the request. Please note my written request, per their instruction, was submitted XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ; as of today, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I have yet to receive a resolution from Ocwen. For your reference, please note the following : On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I purchased a single family property located at : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, XXXX # XXXX with a first loan in the amount of {$430000.00} through XXXX XXXX XXXX Mortgage and a second loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$100000.00}. Approximately XXXX month later after funding the loan, XXXX XXXX sold the servicing rights to XXXX Mortgage which was subsequently sold to GMAC in or around XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. GMAC filed for bankruptcy and the remaining assets were acquired by Ocwen in or around XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX including my loan, account number # XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I short sold the property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX ( Ocwen 's records show XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, and should say "" XXXX '' ) ; however, this did not report accurately on my credit report and it was found that as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the balance of the second loan is still reflected on my credit report. My wife and I are currently in the process of obtaining a full conditional approval for a mortgage loan through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Due to the fact that Ocwen is still on my credit report, we have not received the approval and this is negatively impacting my FICO score as the balance shows unpaid. I escalated the matter to Ocwen 's Office of the Consumer Ombudsman on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and have provided all legal and recorded documentation indicating that as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I am no longer responsible for this property. A copy of The Substitute of Trustee & Deed of Full Reconveyance filed XXXX XXXX, XXXX with the County of XXXX XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX followed by the Full Reconveyance filed XXXX XXXX, XXXX with XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX Mortgage have all been provided and are in possession of Ocwen. To help speed the resolution process, I also provided copies of the outgoing wire sent by the Title Company to GMAC, the escrow settlement statement and the short sale approval letters. I am respectfully requesting Ocwen to provide proof that the loan is no longer in my name, have their records updated accordingly and also this matter be reflected on my credit report, having it backdated to the respective XX/XX/XXXX timeframe. I have provided all the necessary documentation and more than complied with all their request. It is unfair to me and my family that this matter has not been resolved and that we continue to miss out on good opportunities to purchase a home. I kindly ask that you please hold Ocwen and its executive office accountable for their actions. This is clearly a violation of RESPA and TILA and unfortunately now find myself with no choice but to escalate this complaint through your regulatory agency, who has jurisdiction over RESPA matters. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

4/2/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"We originally took out a mortgage loan in XXXX. After financial problems forced us into bankruptcy, we went through several lenders. Our mortgage was split in XXXX between XXXX XXXX and Beneficial. We recently settled with HSBC / Beneficial for a loan modification after 5 years in foreclosure status. When our bankruptcy was dismissed in XXXX, the monthly loan amounts went to XXXX per month from XXXX. We continually received monthly statements from the company, with that monthly amount, until it was reduced to {$890.00} in XXXX ( statements attached ). The amount we owed on the principal was outstanding at XXXX and the total amount due was {$290000.00} as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. A year and a half a go we secured our XXXX lawyer, and there was an agreement for a loan modification in XXXX XXXX. He arrived at an agreement with the mortgage company, which we reluctantly took, rather than be forced out of our home. The cost for the modification was {$4000.00}, plus a XXXX payment of {$810.00}. We felt hurried to make this agreement because in XXXX XXXX we were due to go to court and our lawyer assured us we would lose the house, because the judge was "" tough '', in his words, and the opposing attorney only gave him XXXX options, the worse being ejected from our home in the middle of winter ( email attached ). In hindsight we would have asked the court to scrutinize the amount we need to pay over the next 20 years, plus a balloon payment of over {$100000.00}. Our new monthly will be {$790.00}, with {$89.00} going to the principal, {$200.00} going to interest, and {$490.00} going to taxes in an escrow account. The fixed interest is 6 %. Because our home was damaged by XXXX XXXX we can not fix our home to where we can secure insurance. Our yearly income is a {$XXXX} pension and {$XXXX} from part time work. We fear we will never get equity in the home, as our home has been valued around {$190000.00}. We have always acknowledged a willingness to repay the debt, originally take out by my deceased father-in-law. But it is the amount we are repaying, and the failure to give us a reason why the monthly amounts were so high. We originally took out the mortgage with XXXX XXXX until we went into bankruptcy and they sold the note. After that we could never confirm an actual amount owed, even with our lawyer, who was later relieved of his license by the state. Our XXXX lawyer, did not know anything about bankruptcy so he hired an other to work with us. They had a disagreement and she quit. We tried to contact him, but he never returned our calls nor answered our emails. We tried to get help through an advocacy agency in XXXX XXXX, we gave them all the information, and they asked for more. They stopped communicating with us, and when we finally did contact them, they claimed the funds were gone. We did make a complaint to the agency head. but received an answer not addressing our concern ( see email reply ). Our last lawyer admitted we had a difficult case, and after more than a year he suggested a loan modification. We were not happy with this, because it was five years later, and then the mortgage company decides to do the loan modification. Had this been done 5 years earlier, we would have avoided the interest, which was 8.99 %. Plus, with all this, the question as to why we were charged over {$5000.00} per month for years was answered in a XXXX email from our attorney 's firm, but was never resolved ( see email ). Also, we have a copy of the mortgage company 's attorney writing to our attorney : ... '' I apologize for hounding you, but this matter is set to be service-released to another servicer very shortly and HSBC seeks to get this settlement agreement finalized before that happens ... '' ( email attached ) That 's why we have no confidence in this settlement. We have emails and other correspondence and all other information regarding this case. Thank you.

When I arrived for our appointment they first lied and said they could n't find it, then they found it but refused to release it because a "" mysterious '' person 's name had been added to the account. No one knows who this person is, not even the bank because there was no ssn, date of birth or any other identifying characteristics. The name was a common name that could be XXXX people.

11/25/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"The following is related to U.S. Bank. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I used my checking account-linked debit card to make several purchases. I made these purchases knowing that my checking account was low on funds. I monitored my account throughout the day, frequently checking the balance. I was diligent about not overdrawing the account. At the end of the day, a {$25.00} automatic monthly transfer was made to my savings account even though these funds did not exist. US Bank manipulated the payment processing order so that the {$25.00} automatic transfer was the FIRST payment processed on XXXX, thus a guaranteed overdraft charge. Several days later I was notified of a {$36.00} overdraft fee via mail. Additionally, I was charged a {$25.00} extended overdraft fee, meaning the account was overdrawn for a five day period. I contacted my home branch to explain why the charges were unfair and the branch manager said she could only remove the {$25.00} extended fee. I told her that I would be banking with a different institution so she changed her mind and said she would remove the original {$36.00} fee in an effort to "" help me out '' but not the {$25.00} extended fee that was a result of the original fee. 
All of these events occurred despite the fact that I am "" opted out '' of overdrafts. This option, however, does n't apply if the charge is a recurring monthly charge for gym memberships, XXXX, etc. The charge that put me into overdraft was conveniently my $ 8 monthly XXXX subscription that went through on the same day. I called XXXX to see what time the charge went through on XXXX. It went through at XXXX XXXX. US Bank manipulated the payment processing order so that the automatic recurring XXXX payment was the payment that went through when there were not enough funds to cover it. 
U.S. Bank 's manipulative payment processing resulted in my account being overdrawn by around {$4.00}, leading to {$61.00} in fees.

After it was determined that we would not be able to make all our payments for the month, we decided to put our student loans into forbearance. But for whatever reason, the loan payments were posted to our account on Tuesday, putting our checking account into overdraft. There were multiple other payments that were posted ( that I could not cancel, because they were pending ) on Wed and Thurs. By Thurs morning, the damage had been done. A total of ( XXXX ) {$36.00} overdraft fees were charged to my account. I 've worked with my bank to dispute the loan payments that were made in error. With PNC 's track record, I am confident that a few of these transactions were processed in such an order to maximize fees, such as was done to me previously this year. Because of the {$250.00} in fees I now do not have the funds for my car payment, and will be in the negative again next month ( perpetual cycle of abuse ) because I am on a fixed income. It 's a snowball effect, and we are being overwhelmed. This is abuse!!! We have our first child on the way and are trying to move into a cheaper apartment, and PNC is interfering with our attempts at a reasonable life! How long will the abuses continue? I demand reversal of ALL fees charged to my account IMMEDIATELY. These fees are obliterating any financial gains we have made.

A week later I recd a letter in the mail stating the same thing ... which was followed by another call from me to the customer service center and i was told that I was not even the primary card holder on this card and there was no balance whatsoever. Then about 2 weeks later i started getting collection calls and was now told that not only I was the primary cardholder, there was a balance of about {$1000.00} on it. How can a closed card have balance??!!! 
I then emailed their senior executive leadership member to intervene and resolve this case. I got a couple of emails from the executive admin that they will look into the matter and have updated the credit bureau of the error. My repeated requests of a phone call to understand the situation have been ignored. Its been three months and i still do n't have a resolution to my case nor any acknowledgment from American Express that the case has been closed. 
Please help me. I take my credit standing and obligations very seriously and this matter has robbed me of peace of mind. Am i a victim of ID theft? card skimming? what?

7/30/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"I begin the process of trying to refinance my condo in XX/XX/XXXX 2015. I began this process knowing that I would be laid off in a few months and wanted to get it started as I stated in my original affidavit to CCO Mortgage. I submitted all the paperwork requested within a timely matter. The initial process letter stated that if I supplied all that was needed in the allotted time the process should take no more than XXXX days. It has been XXXX months and I have still have not finalized my loan modification. Throughout these last XXXX months I have had to call my relationship manager over and over again. My constant complaint is not getting any information about what programs for which I would be considered. No one at the bank would tell me about any of the programs or how long the process would take. It was not until I received the letter saying I declined the modification that I saw the list. To this day, no one will tell me what those programs are or if I ever qualified. It is near impossible to get your relationship manager over the phone. When they do decide to get back to you, they leave no message. If you do manage to catch one of those early morning or late Friday afternoon calls its only to tell you they will call you again.When I finally did catch someone the last week of XXXX of 2015, I was told I was approved for a modification for 4 %, instead of my 4.875 %. I still had yet to the acceptance paperwork which I was told was mailed. I told the representative at that time I had been laid off. She took it on her own accord to throw out my modification acceptance without as much as a word to me. XXXX weeks later I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, but was not mailed until XXXX XXXX in the mail stating my modification was declined because I did not accept the agreement. This was a flat out lie. By the time the paperwork came, it was too late to appeal by mail because it was mailed over XXXX days after being generated and only XXXX days were given on the notice. I immediately called letting them know this was a terrible error and the representative they had no right to do that especially since she was not my relationship manager. I was told they would reopen the case and the first payment would be due on XXXX XXXX, where I would be contacted to make the new payment over the phone because that was the only way. Of course when XXXX XXXX, 2015 came I did not receive any phone call. I called XXXX times, after XXXX hours I spoke to the representative who said they were going to call me and she quickly denied everything and they told me I would have to start all over again with the process. I told them no, they were at fault not me and they were doing this on purpose trying to force me into foreclosure with this so called process. Finally they took the payment over the phone and said someone would contact me when the paperwork was mailed. No surprise I did not get a call, I had to call my relationship manager again where I was told it would be sent XXXX. Again the document date was XXXX XXXX, 2015 and I did not receive it until XXXX XXXX, 2015 and FedEx overnight back on the XXXX of XXXX. I was sent 3 copies and was told by my relationship manager that only 2 copies were needed. I missed a phone call this morning, XXXX XXXX, 2015, which no message was left and phoned back to inquire about the missed call. My relationship manager said the paperwork had to be resent because XXXX paper was n't signed and XXXX had a different date. I asked why they could not use the XXXX sets that were signed and dated properly and she did not have an answer. I also told her that my account in showing delinquent due to this long process even though I was making the payments directly to them. Now my credit would be affected it this process did not speed up because I was unemployed now. I can not afford a mortgage delinquency on my credit report.

6/1/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I signed up to M and T auto draft on XXXX/XXXX/2015. The purpose of auto draft was for M and T to automatically draft my payments for my mortgage. M and T sent me an email thanking me for signing up for the service on XXXX/XXXX/2015. The email stated that I did not need to reply and I received no further correspondence in regards to the auto draft. All bill notices I receive from M and T indicate that if I am signed up for auto draft, the bill will be automatically paid. I have attached those emails. 

On XXXX/XXXX/2015 a letter was sent to me indicating that I could lose my home due to failure to make payments. I immediately contacted the bank after receiving the letter and made the payment of the phone. I wanted to dispute the late charges as I felt it was due to an M and T error/ miscommunication. I also wanted confirmation that it was not reported to the credit bureaus as the late payments were due to M and T not auto drafting. The person on the phone said they could not do that. I asked how I could follow up on that and the rep on the phone stated I could write a letter or go to a branch. 

I went into the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NY XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2015. In the branch I reviewed my concerns and made the above requests. This was escalated to the branch manager and they said they would look into it. I also asked to file a formal complaint and for documentation on M and T banks complaint procedure. The representatives stated that they could not provide this to me and that I could not file a complaint in person in the branch. 

I am at an absolute loss for what to do and I feel bullied by misinformation and apathy by M and T bank. They have a large amount of control over their customer 's lives and must be accountable for their actions. It is a simple case of an error that they made and they have done nothing to help fix it. 

I am requesting the fees to be waived, documentation that they did not contact any of the credit reporting agencies and for them to make filing a complaint easy so that issues can be identified and addressed. I would also like to be pointed in the direction of where I can locate my rights as a consumer when it comes to being able to file complaints with banking institutions. I have dealt with an unnecessary amount of anxiety over this issue with no assistance from the bank holding my mortgage.

9/2/2015,Mortgage,VA mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"I started a VA loan with JP Morgan Chase bank on XXXX/XXXX/15. The loan is now at about XXXX days and the manager whom took over about day XXXX, request that I cancel my application and reeinstate a new one, when the VA approves, because of extension costs, to the tune of {$1000.00} per each XXXX days they have to wait, and that which would be charged to the customer XXXX us XXXX. Problem is they submitted the loan to the VA around XXXX ago ( approx. day XXXX XXXX. Manager, XXXX XXXX, will tell you there was a "" miss-communication '' on how many days it would take the VA to approve the loan, by the origional loan officer, XXXX XXXX, to provide as a cover up, but it was alot more than that. Immediately there were inconsistancys. XXXX XXXX, had a series of personal issues, at first my wife and I were very sympathetic, as he told us on XXXX/XXXX/15, his father XXXX. But as time went on, around day XXXX of the loan, a phone conversation sparked when I called to see what is going on with the loan. He wrestled with this, has me on the phone over an hour, stating, "" I called the VA and they need Condo Approval, they need ccrs, minutes, package '', and granted, not only did I pay immediately for this info, there were uncertainty 's and inconsistancys with him knowing in speaking with the VA, on "" new stamps of documents '', being as I provided them from day XXXX. I had even given everything they asked for within XXXX days of the start of the loan, with the exception of an annuity letter that had to be drafted from the vault in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office, which, within XXXX weeks I had the document. They can never say, "" I did n't provide info or documents. '' Anyway, I had money of about XXXX dollars in my savings/checking when this started. Now I am flat broke in need of a cashout refinance, and to know avail. I do n't know whether I should walk away from my home, which incidently, XXXX XXXX in that same conversation, suggested "" Bankruptsy '', in which I declined. I advised unfortunately over XXXX years ago, I had to do that, so I ca n't. His response was, "" Ca n't you do Multipal Bankruptsys? "", I responded, "" no, not that I know of, at least not in the state of california. '' anyway, this was absurd, and on par with what we had been dealing with from him. So, the Manager, XXXX XXXX takes over, and now, is giving me a "" wish list promise '' of, when the VA approves, he will have his guy do it, not XXXX, He is promising me a better rate, and expidited process because he will have everything. Let me also advise that XXXX XXXX, just yesterday, in our final conversation, as he has told me that he will reach out to me upon the approval, advised that, to substantiate the extension charges, he could, instead of me canceling, to raise my rate temporarily to cover charges. Even he, I could tell, was n't very comfortable with that. So, I asked him what I should do. And this is where we are. It is very important that you understand that, they did n't know what they were doing when it comes to a VA loan. Calling numerous times to the VA in which they did, even when they were calling my HOA, they would complain of having to leave messages, and calling the wrong prompt on the menu numerous times, a lady which I have the name told me, "" I have told XXXX where to go, what prompt to use several, emphasising, Several Times. When I called twice within, XXXX minutes, and I showed XXXX, I got ahold of them right away, second ring. So, it has just been horrid, my family and I are in a pickle to say the least. Here is the Manager, XXXX XXXX contact XXXX. He is the District Manager of Lending for Chase Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My phone # is XXXX. I am at home and XXXX. Thank you for your time.

After a few days of thinking about it we XXXX decided we did not care for the band very much. So we went into Jared again on XXXX XXXX, we looked and found another band and paid more money for the different ring. They said they were able to exchange the whole item no problem. Then on XXXX XXXX, I went into the store and explained to them that we no longer wanted the ring we purchased and would like to return the item and keep our line of credit but return the item. The employee when we made our first exchange never explained to us that the diamond had 30 days to return and we assumed that that was from XXXX XXXX and they said it was from XXXX XXXX so we had passed the date by 2 days. We were never told that information until XXXX XXXX when we decided to wait on the purchase and buy at a later time. We contacted customer service on XXXX XXXX and explained the situation and when they pulled up the transactions not all the number even added up to her. They were off and she was even confused and had to ask another worker to help her figure out the situation. After speaking with her she said there was nothing they could do to help us return the entire purchase. So we decided to call the jewelry store today and say you know what go ahead and give us our ring and diamond back we will just keep it and forget we ever returned it. The employee said no problem and said it would be ready in a few hours. All of a sudden my husband receives a phone call that now we need to pay Jared another {$200.00} in order to pick up the ring again. Which makes no sense at all if no changes were made to it at all we are just picking up our merchandise again. We feel so taken advantage of by this jewelry store they have not explained things correctly several times and all their number from the transactions see To be off and now they are asking for more and more money which makes no sense.

8/19/2015,Credit card,,Customer service / Customer relations,,"Years ago I used my Bank of America card to keep my XXXX year old mother in a nursing home. The balance soon grew very large. After she passed away I began to repay BofA a larger monthly payment. I did pay monthly {$500.00} a month and XXXX or XXXX times I payed BofA {$1000.00} a month as they requested, to get the balance down. This was very difficult, so I reached an agreement with them to pay $ XXXX monthly I did this automatic payment for about two years. 
About 6 or 9 months ago I noticed the {$200.00} was not being taken from my checking acct. I called BofA and was told my acct. was written off and it was sent to collections. I told them I would have happily continued sending them {$200.00}. They did not contact me in anyway that to say the payments were schedule to stop. I asked what could I do. They said "" nothing, once its gone to collections, there is nothing you can do ''. I asked for the address to begin paying again to a collection agency. Of course this places a negative credit mark for many years on my credit history. It seems so wrong the way they managed my acct. and placed my acct to collections without a tele. call, nor an email, or a letter to give me a chance to continue making payments. This lack of common courtesy to me by sending my acct to collections was wrong, and costs me a lot in higher interest rates throughout my life. I am XXXX years old and do not have a lot of years to wait 7 years for them to remove the "" Sent to collections ''.

11/23/2015,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account status,"Good afternoon, I 'm in need of assistance. I 'm hoping you can see to it that this gets resolved. 

XXXX Bank had the second lien on my property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AZ XXXX. The property went to foreclosure in XXXX. XXXX XXXX was the last reported date on my credit report revealing I was 120 days past due. This was my last time since negative. 

In early XXXX I discovered XXXX was reporting that I had a monthly obligation of {$23000.00} on this old debt. This was reflecting in my monthly DTI. I disputed this information through Experian in late XXXX XXXX when my Credit Score was XXXX. I have been rebuilding my credit since the foreclosure ( XXXX XXXX ) and imagined that this erroneously large monthly obligation 's removal would only help me. Instead, XXXX Bank eliminated the monthly obligation and updated the status to a charge off as of XXXX XXXX. 

Now my credit report says I have a RECENT LATE as of XXXX XXXX - but the last time I was late with payments was XXXX XXXX. Compass recent reporting of my charge off occurred in XXXX XXXX and their adherence to this date makes lenders and other affiliates assume I was recently late on my obligations. But as you can see on the evidence provided I was NOT late on any payments in XXXX XXXX. ( I have n't been late on any payments since XXXX XXXX. ) How could I be late on an account that has been closed since XXXX? XXXX wrote that the balance is past due as of XXXX XXXX but I was 120 days past due from XXXX XXXX. 

I was recently declined a mortgage because of this reporting. Even though the notes say the Charge Off will drop in XXXX suggesting it is an old charge off their reporting is erroneous and inaccurate and make it appear that this is recent. 

Per Experian my Time Since Negative is XXXX years ( point one years ). Please help. I have n't been late since XXXX and it is all related to the foreclosure. 

Please help. The Time Since Negative is completely inaccurate. Please remove the negative date and have it report accurately to reflect that the time I was last negative was XXXX XXXX. 

Thank you kindly.

6/16/2015,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"In XX/XX/XXXX my Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy was approved in the XXXX XXXX BK Court, and a XXXX mortgage from Bank of America was crammed down to a balance of {$27000.00} and payments of {$100.00} per month were to commence starting XX/XX/XXXX. The Trustee XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, CA ) made XXXX payments of {$100.00} each to Bank of America, they then sold or transferred the loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. The first payment of {$100.00} was due and mailed to XXXX XXXX, XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX as per their request. XXXX Recieved XXXX further payments of {$100.00} each, until I got a XXXX Mortgage in XXXX and paid off all lien holders except the XXXX Mortgage at XXXX Mortgage of seeking a discharge, which is now in process. The Escrow was opne at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA. When they requested a demand for payoff from XXXX XXXX, XXXX submitted a payoff demand of {$27.00}, XXXX with an amount in excess of {$1000.00} calling it a short payment. The true and correct demand should be {$23.00}, XXXX. When questioned by me they said that Bank of America had entered an extra fee after transfer of the loan in XX/XX/XXXX and they were collecting that. I told XXXX XXXX, XXXX that I had called Bank of America and they said they had transferred a balance of {$26000.00} only. On further checking I learned that they Bank of America had made an ectry on my account of {$1000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX after releasing the loan, this is not permitted by Bankruptcy law and they are well aware of it, if they are seeking additional fees they must apply to the BK Court in XXXX XXXX, hold a hearing and get permission from the Court based on the application by their lawyers. over the course of XXXX years they have had XXXX different law firms represent them in my case, so they are not lacking for knowledge or information in this respect. This is clearly willfull disregard of the BK laws and they were seeking to make additional money when they can not do that. I have called both Bank of America and XXXX XXXX, XXXX again today and neither has provided any answers or a solution. Bank of America says the notes on my account state that the research ticket is closed due to the Service Release and XXXX XXXX, XXXX says they have no additional knowledge, but they did tell me that the payoff that they recieved from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of {$27000.00} was still short, even though it was based on their own demand and they have not provided a re conveyance nor a refund. This is a joint complaint against both Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for willful disregard of BK laws and acting behind the scenes to inflate my payoff when legally they have received XXXX payments of {$100.00} from the Trustee XXXX XXXX 's office and the payoff and balance should be {$2300.00}. Kindly contact both banks and research the matter and get my due refund of {$1000.00} from XXXX, XXXX. XXXX and a re conveyance as their loan has been paid off. Thank you.

8/19/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"I obtained private student loans while attending XXXX University ( XXXX ), formerly known as XXXX XXXX University ( XXXX ). My father cosigned for these loans. Approximately XXXX years ago, my parents filed for a chapter XXXX bankruptcy. The student loans were not a part of this bankruptcy. They were a direct pay form the primary loanee, which is me. My father was just a cosigner, and regardless of the chapter XXXX bankruptcy, would have fulfilled his obligation as cosigner if I were not to pay. The bankruptcy is now paid off. My student loans have been in good standing throughout the entire chapter XXXX bankruptcy. On XX/XX/XXXX, my mother receives a call from a rep from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) stating that they were trying to collect a debt from my father, the cosigner, because the student loans were defaulted. They stated that I owed a total of XXXX from XXXX private student loans. I was confused because I have always kept my accounts in good standing. They were only in an approved forbearance since XX/XX/XXXX ( which is still in good standing ). My mother gave me the number to call XXXX. When I spoke to the rep, she told me that my loans were in default, and that I needed to pay in full. She did not know why my loans were listed as delinquent. They gave an option for me to pay approximately {$33000.00} if I wanted to pay in full ; or I could pay off XXXX loan for approximately {$9000.00} and make approximately $ XXXX/month payments until the rest of the debt was resolved. I was not offered any more options. She also told me that I needed to act quickly because all three loans were accruing interest separately/daily. I then called the company that was servicing my loans, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). The rep there told me that they no longer service my student loans because the owner/guarantor decides what is done with the loans when a bankruptcy is filed. They stated that the owner/guarantor put the loans in default due to the Chapter XXXX bankruptcy from the cosigner ... even though the bankruptcy is paid off and that I made payments throughout the entire life of the bankruptcy. The owner/guarantor of my loans is Transworld System Inc ( TSI ). When I called TSI, the rep told me that my loans were put in default due to a breach of contract when the cosigner filed a bankruptcy. I explained to them that the student loans were not included in the bankruptcy, and that the bankruptcy had been paid off ; not to mention, I made payments throughout the life of the bankruptcy. They told me that it did not matter. They said that they received notification from the government that a chapter XXXX bankruptcy had been paid off by the cosigner which prompted them to put the loans in default due to a breach in contract. I asked if I could have a letter of verification stating this information and why my loans were defaulted, and the rep told me that they did not send out any letters like that and that it was due to a breach in contract. I do not have huge amounts of money laying around to pay out like they want. I do not want loans listed in default on my credit, this was not my bankruptcy. Is this right? Can you please help? Thank you for your time! 
XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for the repXXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXI will attach bank statements of payments. The payments vary in amount due to being in XXXX for a period of time. They are listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX on the statements. I have included the first and last statement of the year for years XX/XX/XXXX through the end of XXXX. The loans were in forbearance as of XXXX. I was not aware that my loans were defaulted until XX/XX/XXXX. I received nothing in writing at that point. I was told that a letter from XXXX was on its way in the mail for my father and I each at my parents ' address.

As everyone knows, the economy crashed and I lost my job/ business that I had owned for over 20 years. We could n't afford our home anymore and so we moved out. We tried renting it, selling it, we tried everything. Our lender -PNC Mortgage- suggested that we do a "" deed in lieu of foreclosure "" which we completed in XXXX of 2015. 
Each month since then we get a late notice collection letter that each month has new late charges, interest and fees on this loan that we do n't have anymore. We do n't own the home now. 
They are continually reminding us and hounding us with these notices. I call them each time and they tell me every time that our deed in lieu is complete and that my loan is in maintenance and to disregard the notices. But I keep getting them and this is a very emotional, hurtful harassing thing they keep doing, reminding us every month that we lost our home. We are starting over and trying to forget and get past this terrible time.

I also have a saving account that I had opened at the same time as the checking, and had changed the name on my account with XXXX, so the funds would only come in under my name, and there would n't be a problem with me receiving my funds. The funds come from the same source, and TCF is ignoring that fact, and has not tried to verify the funds from where they came. They have repeatedly lied to me about their investigation and have not on any level to contact me, or allowed me to speak to home ever is responsible for keeping the hold on the account. They wo n't even have the courage to speak to me directly and answer any of my questions for what legal reason they have for their actions. XXXX XXXX XXXX Tax Products Group, the bank that I have a partnership with and also the source of the ACH deposits has yet to be contacted to be asked for verification of funds, and has also sent XXXX requests for the funds to be returned back to them, but their requests have also been ignored by TCF. I am being told by there customer service department, that they are waiting on the IRS to tell them what to do about the funds, but the funds did n't come from the IRS, and unless they start with the origins of where the funds came from, the IRS ca n't answer the questions of this issue, because they did n't send the funds to TCF bank. 
I am sending my business reports, as well as other documentation that I have also sent to TCF bank, that clearly should have answered the question of this problem, along with contact information and my account number for them, that they may be able to also provide verification about this the source of the funds and why I had received the funds.

I was offered a modification with them several years ago after the XXXX shock and agreed to it. The mod is fixed 4 % interest only for the remainder of life of the line of credit. Two months ago I noticed that the payment increased and discovered their system of record reflects 4.25 % instead of the 4 %. Several calls in the last six weeks while waiting on a research ticket to be resolved to remedy this situation has gone ignored. Their executive office halted the continued montly ACH from my savings account and now I am having to call in payments due to non-corrective action on their part. According to the executive office, they do not know why their computer is not correcting the rate back to 4 %. We are making ( estimated ) payments now based on previous years payments based on the respective month. The fact that a mortgage servicing company can not explain, nor correct something as critical as the interest rate is egregious. Please help me!

I submitted documents given to me by the XXXX agent in XXXX and XXXX is saying that it is not enough, and Transunion is refusing to remove it at all from my credit record with no explanation saying it will remain on my credit record until XXXX, when it never should have been made in the first place. So because Transunion and XXXX would rather play nice with the XXXX rather than do the right thing, my credit score is about XXXX pts lower than it should be. I would like XXXX these companies ordered to remove any record of that tax lien from my credit record as XXXX has done. All XXXX companies received the same information and the same letter from me explaining that the XXXX up but only XXXX understood the issue. If they still refuse to remove any reference to the lien, I will be forced to take legal action against them in federal court for deliberate wrongful reporting of a credit record, which is fraud. I am unable to attach the XXXX records at this time but can mail you a copy if you request it.

A few years back I noticed that Midland Funding showed up on my credit report and disputed it through XXXX and XXXX because I did n't know who they were. I received a letter from the credit reporting agency that they did not respond so it was removed. Last year my work received a garnishment letter from the Sheriff. I was given this information from my employeer. I contacted Midland Funding who referred me to the collection agency they had turned it over to. When I contacted the collection agency the informed me that this was for XXXX XXXX XXXX. I financed a vehicle for my family member back in 2001 and never knew the vehicle was taken back by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was able to verify the date that the last payment was made. I contacted the courts to see when a judgement was filed. I contacted an attorney who informed me that the statue to file a judgement in NY was six years from the last payment. After verifying this the judgement was filed after six years and I was never served with paper from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Midland Funding or the collection agency that they were suing me for this debt. The collection agency informed me that payments were made to them in the last coule of years, I asked them for copies of these payments made which they said they could n't provide me. This clearly is because I never made payments to them and my family member who I financed the vehicle never made payments them either. I want proof of these payments made within the statue of limitations which were never provided. I was informed to file a complaint through this site and am also going to seek an attorney as well to assit with this matter. I would like assistance to find out how they can violate the law and not provide me with this so called payment that I made to this account. I would like this documentation but none of them will provide me with this because it is not the case. I was told that you could assist with getting them to provide this since their acting in violation of the states laws. I notice that the collection agency they placed this with has been sued several times due to this. I was told I could also file something with the attorney general which I will also be ding today.

8/6/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"My husband and I have been working with CitiMortgage for a modification application since 2012. After repeatedly sending in the same documentation and clarification they ask for, I am always denied because they claim documentation was not turned in. I keep records and confirmations of all documents sent and also keep logs of every phone call I make or receive from the lender. It seems at this point there are just giving me the run around and forcing me to fall further and further into debt so they can sell my home. I wish they would acknowledge all the work I am doing on my end to keep being productive and following up instead of giving me the run around and giving me false hope. I also felt as though the relationship manager that was assigned to my file was discriminating me due to my race and always had a serious attitude with me and did not want to help and make things more difficult for me. I had to ask for a new relationship manager because he made me feel horrible about my situation. I feel I have been dealing with this unfortunate situation for too long and need to address the situation so it does not happen to others as well. So now at this point I have a projected sale in XXXX due to their underhanded tactics and they are pushing me against the wall before a sale and I would like them to review me for a modification and conduct themselves in a professional manner and provide with me foreclosure options as California Law state. Thank you.

XXXX paid all claims submitted by providers. XXXX provider, Colorado XXXX XXXX, says they repeatedly submitted a claim to XXXX but the claim was denied. XXXX 's records show no claim was ever submitted by Colorado XXXX XXXX. The medical provider acknowledges they had complete and accurate insurance information for me and that I did my part of the process as a consumer. The medical provider did not perform their due diligence in submitting the claim in a timely manner. Once one year from the date of service had passed, they say they sent me a bill. I did not receive a bill from them and doubt the bill was sent ; it seems that they claim to have billed me the same as they claim to have submitted to XXXX, but no record can be found. They sent the account to collections and say I was notified, but I can locate no record of notification. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I was served with a summons indicating I am being sued for the amount. It should be noted the summons was dated XXXX XXXX, but not issued until a full month later. Once I received the summons I contacted XXXX and Colorado XXXX XXXX. XXXX asked that the company resubmit. The staff member at Colorado XXXX XXXX assured me they would resubmit the claim. They did not. I had to contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for assistance. They were able to review XXXX claim logs for the entire year and verified that the medical company had not ever submitted the claim. They will not submit now, which is needed for XXXX to issue me a statement of benefits showing I owe them nothing. 

Now, I am being sued for the amount of the bill, collections fees, and court fees. For something that is the fault of the health care company not following procedure. I am livid that I have no consumer protection from this sort of senseless lawsuit when I had insurance that would have paid the claim if it had been submitted.

After I discovered I could not access my account, I called the customer service number and was informed that my account had been closed on XXXX. Nobody could tell me why, but they explained that a check was "" in the mail '' for my account balance, and I would be receiving correspondence that would provide some level of clarity to the situation. 

GE Capital provided me with a tracking number for the supposed package being mailed from them. After submitting a tracking inquiry via XXXX, I learned that my check was actually being mailed to GE Capital 's headquarters. According to XXXX, that check arrived at their headquarters on Wed, XXXX/XXXX/2016 at XXXX. 

I called GE Capital back to hopefully gain some clarity on the matter without satisfaction. Was not provided a reason for closing of the account or an estimated time frame or a reasonable expectation for when I might receive my check. I attempted to escalate the issue to a "" Floor Manager '' and unfortunately obtained no new information regarding what had happened or what will happen. 

The following day I receive a call from GE Capital from a representative "" dedicated '' to these types of problems. I was informed that the check was in fact not coming to me. I was informed that the check was, in fact, being sent to their headquarters for a "" review ''. And that after the review was complete, my check would be processed and sent to me. I was also told that I would be contacted and provided with a tracking number for the check once their "" review '' was complete. Was told that I should hear from them by XX/XX/2016. 

It 's now Friday XX/XX/2016, and I 've heard from nobody at GE Capital. My account was a savings account only in which I make monthly deposits ranging from {$200.00} - {$2000.00}. 

So, without any further information, I contacted my attorney and a close friend of mine who is a XXXX. My friend has informed me that the only possible reason this could be happening is if GE Capital 's internal systems have generated a "" Suspicious Activity Report '' on my account. 

Now I would like to file a "" Suspicious Activity Report '' on GE Capital. Oops. Forgot ... .I do n't have the right to do something like that. I 'm only a U.S. citizen. Not an XXXX banking institution.

When I called the collections dept at XXXX the woman was belligerent and said well the woman never said you were covered 100 % - she quibbled over words but to me not owing anything and 100 % is a difference without distinction. The fact is that the lady who called the insurance company was an agent of the hospital. When I asked her professional opinion she gave me the wrong information. They are telling me I owe them XXXX which is unfair b/c had I known that I would owe my own money toward the service I never would have had it done. I am deeply troubled by their comments/attitude/lack of knowledge.

1/31/2016,Debt collection,Mortgage,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"We are filing a dispute regarding the failure for Bank of America ( BAC ) to complete a modification review under Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ). 
Our loan was originated in XXXX with XXXX Mortgage Company, which in deed makes our family eligible for the review of HAMP programs and all of the programs original intent and initiatives for benefit of homeowner such as myself. It is unlawful on multiple levels for our loan to be discriminated and excluded from review of such programs based on XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) being named as investor/owner for our mortgage loan. Although we are thankful for consideration and approval of a modification program, we are dishearten by the fact that BAC, and XXXX are purposely overlooking our family for a much more beneficial program than what has been offered on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
The reasons given for our multiple denials of HAMP not only are ambiguous, but also evasive and without detail or relevant cause and appear to be a ploy to avoid offering our family a deeper savings at 31 % of our gross income. My theory, is that both BAC and OLS presumed the HAMP program to be dissolved at the end of XXXX, and the denials were a preemptive decision made prior to the FHFA 's announcement made that HAMP was being extended until the end of XXXX. 

Both BAC and XXXX, are major participants of the HAMP program and it is completely out of character of industry standards since XXXX and in the wake of both financial institutes losing federal lawsuits for thousands of acts of deception, abuse and fraud of homeowners nationwide. In fact there are still thousands of pending and unresolved lawsuits against of XXXX. The lawsuits allege, among other things, that XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) engaged in a deceptive scheme to delay or deny permanent mortgage loan modifications through the federal Home Affordable Modification Program ( "" HAMP '' ) to desperate homeowners, systematically breaching their contractual obligations to homeowners, committing deceptive trade practices, and causing significant financial harm. 

Our loan was approved of what 's called a Bank of America loan modification, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for a payment in the amount of {$1200.00}. Based on my gross qualifying monthly income of {$3500.00}, the payment equates to a front end debt to income ( DTI ) ratio of 36 % to 40 %. However, had our loan been reviewed accordingly for the HAMP program, our payments would be based upon 31 % DTI, equating to a much more affordable amount of {$1000.00}. 

We are seeking for our loan to be reconsidered for the HAMP program. We are seeking a more thorough and detailed explanation as to why we are being overlooked for a program that we rightfully should be considered and qualified to receive. This complaint will be forwarded to the our state attorney general as well as Michigan Department of Financial Institution for their review of my grievances.

Not long after I initiated the wire transfer process, I received a telephone call from the Wells Fargo Fraud Unit informing me that I am probably the victim of fraud and that I should contact my bank ( XXXX ) immediately to have the wire transfer stopped and/or recalled ; due to the 6-hour time difference I was not able to contact my bank until the following morning when they opened. The Wells Fargo Fraud Unit did not take any steps to stop or intercept the fraudulent wire transfer that they called me about! 

I sent the money to : XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attn : XXXX XXXX Phone ( XXXX ) XXXX Wells Fargo Deposited to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX I immediately filed a felony criminal complaint with the XXXX Police Department via telephone and they have since arrested and charged XXXX XXXX with felony fraud. I have been working steadfastly with XXXX trying to resolve this issue and to get Wells Fargo to refund my money via reverse wire transfer since Wells Fargo identified the wire transfer as fraud, recognized that they were depositing into a personal account instead of a business account and that the account holder 's names were not the same and did not intercept or place the wire transfer on hold until it could be verified. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo bank has given me nothing but lip service and the run-around and wasting my time while I tried to resolve this amicably. My bank ( XXXX ) wire transfer department has sent the Wells Fargo bank no less than a dozen secure XXXX messages trying to recover this money that they put into the wrong account. However, Wells Fargo has completely ignored my bank and refused to even respond to them too. 

I am attaching a true copy of the original wire transfer instrument to this complaint. Please investigate and make Wells Fargo bank follow the rules and refund my money.

But we were n't even to that point yet to go forward. besides who is to say that I cant pay the maintence fee that is owed. But my main concern is, who gave the right to go and spend on my behalf with out letting me know there will be charges. I know the note gives them the right to pay for force insurance, but even then they send you letter letting you know before they spend it. I know if I was behind in the mortgage it gives them the right to hire a attorney to pursue me. In this case I '' m not behind and I was only inquiring.

I took out a private loan via XXXX XXXX when I went to XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, New Jersey. The post-graduation hiring rates were vastly lower than expected, most of my classmates actually went on to work in different fields than that which they studied at XXXX. The "" teacher '' must have had little to no teaching credentials seeing as the in class book work was rarely done properly. At the end of my program, expecting to receive more assistance than I did from the career services department, it took me months to get hired at all, and I spent the first month of employment working at an location who had no previous affiliation with the school and whose method of operation was horrendous. I was hired at my current location based on a recommendation by a previous classmate. This location had an affiliation with the school and offered a loan repayment incentive for all graduates of XXXX. XXXX services, however, did not mention that I had to be hired before graduation and also did n't push me to see this employer before graduating. I did not receive this loan repayment incentive and am now having trouble paying this loan back while I 'm also paying back my federal loans. I am being harassed continually by their collectors. My phone rings at least XXXX times on a slow day with them calling me. They have called me at work and at all kinds of obscene hours, both too early and too late in the day. I have tried to reach out to a loan forgiveness program when I heard that a classmate of mind received information on reducing her private loan debt, but the information was a dead end. I feel that XXXX did not hold up their end of the bargain and fed me to the sharks with this private loan. And now, since the lawsuit against XXXX XXXX has been taken up XXXX XXXX XXXX has since transfered it 's loan accounts, or at least mine to University XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I have been out of school since 2013 and paying back my loan since then, now having made payments to XXXX different companies and yet have only started to make a dent in the principal balance I borrowed. I have been paying them interest, emptying my pockets to line theirs and have been digging myself deeper into debt. I would like some retribution.

They stated XXXX charges which were not mine. Then they said that they would send me a statement of fraud to fill out, which I did and returned within about 2 weeks and it would take them 60-90 days to process. Then I received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX stating that they were going to lower my credit limit, so I then called again and I was transferred to collections. I then sent in XXXX letters on XXXX separate dates stating that these charges were fraud, I paid off my valid charges and filed a police report. I also received a letter XX/XX/XXXX that stated that my charges were found not be fraud which was allegedly sent in error because the fraud department said that the investigation was still ongoing. In XXXX XXXX, I placed yet another call to the fraud department and was informed that my claim was processed incorrectly and they just closed my account, issued a new card but never flagged the charges as fraud so I had to fill out another fraud affidavit which I mailed and faxed back and was told it would take another 60-90 days to process the claim. Then in XXXX XXXX, I received a collection letter giving me payment options and I called customer service and was informed that my claim came back as not fraud and I asked for a manager, they would not transfer me and then said they could have their manager call back which they never did. Then on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I spoke with a representative in the "" consumer protection '' or fraud department again and they said that the fraud investigation was ongoing and that they would expedite it. After this call, in XXXX for the period of a week I received 18 collection calls to my home during the day while I was at work. I then had to call Fraud dept to have them have the calls stopped since this was fraud. Then on XXXX XXXX, XXXX I called and was told that it could take another 3 weeks for the fraud investigation to be completed. In XXXX XXXX, I was advised that my account was charged off to Citibank even though there was a pending fraud investigation and I was never given an answer as to whether the charges were deemed fraud or not, and that I would have to contact them. When I contacted Citibank they were unable to help me and directed me back to the fraud department at Macys in which they stated that they didnt understand why the account was charged off since it shouldnt have been with a pending fraud claim. XX/XX/XXXX, I tried calling the fraud department at least 5 times being on hold for times of up to 30 mins and with no one answering the phone and I could n't be on hold for an hour. I then called again and finally got in touch with someone and was on the phone for my whole lunch hour and had to hang up because I had to go to work. I was advised that a manager was going to remove the charges, fix my credit and contact Citibank to clear anything up within 3 business days. I then received a collection letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX which tried to collect the money from me. I then called another 4 times to the Fraud department to see what was going on with my charges being removed and yet again there was unbelievable wait times. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I called and finally got someone on the phone and was on the phone for a total of 45 minutes and was told that the charges have not been removed and they would have to speak to manager about it and I would have to call back again. A few days later I called back and was told that since the account was charged off that they would have to do another fraud investigation which could take another 90 days.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Citibank,NY,117XX,,Consent provided,Web,4/27/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,1899203

2/10/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"I have been having a lot of problems with Chase bank employees, inconsistent practices and advice. On XXXX, XXXX charged me for a XXXX membership when I was trying to rent a movie. The charge was XXXX. I immediately called XXXX and was told that it would take 14 business days. I could n't afford that. It was right after XXXX. I made purchases on XXXX using my XXXX account so there were several different debit transactions that were all done separately. I had enough trouble keeping track of that. Not knowing what else to do, I called Chase to tell them what happened and how XXXX said they could n't refund for 14 business days. The associate told me that I had to file a claim. I explained to both associates, the one that answered the phone and the one that opened the claim, I did call XXXX and they said it would take 14 business days. They filed the claim and told me they would issue a temporary credit until they could retrieve the funds from the merchant. 
At the time this was going on, my father in law was in the hospital. He XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I was not looking at my bank account the few days before his death. As I said, I called Chase with a problem and that 's how it was handled. Fast forward to today, XXXX XXXX. I get up for work and my bank account is in the negative. There was a credit reversal. I called and found out that XXXX refunded the money on the XXXX and Chase added the credit on XXXX two days after I called. They said they sent me an email telling me that they would be taking the funds back. I did n't get the email. I have had problems with my email account since this year someone filed a fraudulent tax refund under my social security number. I have had many problems with my gmail account and believe that may have compromised as well. Either way, I did n't see the email so this was a complete surprise. Chase however, said that it was my responsibility to monitor my account and see that they had credited me after the refund. I was also told that I should NOT have filed a claim since that is only done in cases of fraud. I explained that I was n't the one that made that decision. I called and told them what happened and that it was Chase employees that decided what to do. How is that my fault? I asked them about overdraft fees after this, since there was an error and they said I would be responsible. I spoke to fraud after that to go over the situation and was told by that associate there is an annual limit on overdraft fees that the bank can charge. I was not aware of this. She transferred me back to the general customer service number. That associate told me she is n't sure why I was told that but that overdraft fees are not capped and they can charge up to 5 per day. She advised me to go to the branch and freeze my account. I called again as I was on the way and was told that I could not do this since it was n't due to fraud. I asked for a supervisor immediately. This was n't the first time I had received conflicting information. The supervisor told me I COULD actually freeze the account which would avoid any overdraft fees. So I turned around and went back. Now, because of the fee reversal and my negative account I could n't put gas in my car and the light had come on. When I arrived at the branch, the associate told me that you could NOT freeze an account unless it was because of fraud. 
I could n't believe that a supervisor told me I could do something that I could not and how poorly trained Chase associates truly are. I have paid hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees and I 'm sure I 'll end up paying more. They are taking advantage of the fact that I 'm in a very tough financial situation and profiting from it.

Presently, I have a Motion for Reconsideration that is scheduled for XXXX XXXX, 2015. The new facts that I have presented in my Motion for Reconsideration involves a Notice of Rescission. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I sent a Notice of XXXX to Nationstar. They received the Notice of Rescission on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Under the Federal Truth In Lending Act, my debt obligation, the promissory note and the deed of trust were canceled immediately, by operation of law. Under the statute, the creditor 's interest in the property is "" automatically negated regardless of its status and whether or not it was recorded or perfected ''. Also under the Act, Nationstar had 20 days from XXXX XXXX, 2015 to challenge my Notice of Rescission by filing a lawsuit against me. They have failed to take any action regarding my Notice of Rescission. Because of their failure to challenge the rescission, they have forever waived any and all defenses to my rescission. Under the Act, Nationstar is now in violation of the law, and they are blatantly disregarding my loan rescission rights. I have sent them a letter of non-compliance and have requested they cancel the sale date that is scheduled on my home Thursday, XXXX XXXX, 2015 and that they forward me a release and a reconveyance as required under the statute. I am filing this complaint to inform the CFPB that Nationstar continues to ignore the law and that they are in violation of a Federal Act. Their actions are unacceptable. I request the CFPB take some kind of disciplinary action against Nationstar for their blatant disregard for the law. I am hoping with your interaction, Nationstar will choose to abide by the Act and take the necessary steps that is required of them by law.

I did n't have that much knowledge but I was interested in a 2008 Chevy Malibu. I purchased the car through AUTONATION of XXXX XXXX and began paying my carnote. I started doin my research and started realizing I was in a upside down loan. Once I told family members where I purchased my car and the price I was paying, their reaction made me do my research to find out what I had gotten my-self into. It had high miles, also my APR was 27 %, with the car depreciating throughout the time I have had the car I am paying {$13000.00} dollars on a car that 's only worth {$3000.00} dollars so that means I am upside down by XXXX or XXXX XXXX. In due time I called my finance bank XXXX AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE XXXX and told them that I do n't like the idea of starting out in a upside car loan and I requested that the car can be picked up for voluntary repossession and I did stop making payments on the vehicle. Finance bank asked if I would like to settle and I replied yes because that would be a better option then having a voluntary repo on my credit so I told them that I went to XXXX and had the value looked at, I told them the car is only worth {$3000.00} and they stated that it 's not and they only can approve it for {$6000.00} to settle. So I am forced to turn the car in because I do n't have that kind of money laying around and I definitely wasnt meeting the requirements of selling the car to a private party. It was brought with fair cosmetic damage, over XXXX miles, and other little mechanic issues, after sometime I would see puddles of water inside trunk, signal indicators was defected and etc. The most I can sell the car for is {$4500.00} even though that is a fairy-tale price I stated that to the finance company they did n't want to help, and the manager was being nasty telling me it 's either I pay the {$6000.00} dollars or I surrender the vehicle it put me in a bad position. I was swindled into this car deal as a first time buyer. I feel like I was overcharged for a vehicle that will not be worth anything before the year is out. So I am forced to turn the vehicle in because I am out of options.

As follows : "" ( 7 ) RESTRICTION ON FEES CHARGED FOR AN OVER-THE-LIMIT TRANSACTION. -- With respect to a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan, an over-the-limit fee may be imposed only once during a billing cycle if the credit limit on the account is exceeded ... '' This was done twice. 

And Section 1 as follows : "" no such fee shall be charged, unless the consumer has expressly elected to permit the creditor, with respect to such account, to complete transactions involving the extension of credit under such account in excess of the amount of credit authorized. '' I did not, and I opted out of their overdraft already. 

Furthermore, section 2 as follows : ' ( 2 ) DISCLOSURE BY CREDITOR. -- No election by a consumer under paragraph ( 1 ) shall take effect unless the consumer, before making such election, received a notice from the creditor of any over-the-limit fee in the form and manner ... '' Pertaining to re-ordering transactions, regulations section XXXX as follows : ' ( B ) [ Law shall ] prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the manipulation of credit limits designed to increase over-the-limit fees or other penalty fees. "" Researching, I found also that a high ranking official of WF as another keynote, stated : "" If multiple transactions come in at the same time, then Wells Fargo will process the lowest dollar amount first, said company spokeswoman XXXX XXXX. "" Simply put and pretty obviously, they are following the money, not the law.

We recognize that the high interest rate makes it difficult to pay down the princple. We have payed consistently on time with no problem. When we have asked to be considered for a lower rate so we can add extra to the payment we are put off with "" its not the kind of loan that can be lowered '' or they can perhaps consider it at a later date. I believe that it is because we have a good payment history and Wells Fargo sees us as a consistent payer and it is to their benefit to keep us in the higher interest rate. We are not asking for any reduction in the debt principle we just want a reduction of the interest rate so we can pay down our debt.

6/27/2016,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"Dear CFPB, I received a call from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( originator ID : XXXX ) from my local US Bank branch, offering me a credit card I was eligible for, which I declined. He also mentioned that I currently had a {$500.00} overdraft protection account, and I could be eligible for a line of credit up to {$5000.00} at a lower interest rate. I told him I was interested and authorized him to proceed with a credit check to determine the amount and terms of my eligibility. 
The very next contact I received was a VOICEMAIL from XXXX XXXX, telling me that I have been approved at {$5000.00}, that the account has been set up, that I 'd receive a credit card in the mail ( which is what I clearly did n't want in the first place ) that I could just not use, and that it was at a lower interest rate than my previous overdraft account. This turned out to be 13.5 %, though I was never told that until much later. 
A few days later I received a letter from US Bank showing me my XXXX credit score for this loan at XXXX as of XXXX. I found this to be an error, as I keep very close track to my XXXX and XXXX credit scores, XXXX of which have been at XXXX for quite some time and have had absolutely no major changes that would result in a XXXX point swing over the course of 9 days. I logged onto XXXX on XXXX and found my credit score to in fact be XXXX. 
Upon contacting the bank about this, XXXX XXXX did in fact verify that he saw my credit score as currently XXXX. I was told by the manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, that they had it on file as of XXXX at XXXX and there was nothing we could do about it for another 6 months until the next review of my creditworthiness. I called US Bank 's credit services and worked my way XXXX levels up the customer support chain to speak to a very kind gentleman ( XXXX? ) who explained that there is literally not a mechanism in the US Bank system that lets them manually review/adjust someone 's credit score. I was n't asking for anything special, all I wanted was an account with an interest rate based on my credit score. Due to the lack of a mechanism to achieve this, what I had to settle for is to reapply now, get it approved at the correct rate ( which will result in a second inquiry to my credit ). 
With that as the backdrop, I have XXXX primary issues that I 'm reporting to the XXXX : -First and foremost, these strike me as incredibly loose and dangerous lending practices, and I can not imagine US Bank would approve of or teach this process. The terms of the line of credit were NEVER discussed or agreed to by me prior to the account being set up, namely the interest rate and the score it was based upon, fees, terms, etc. If it had, I would have said I disagreed with the score at that time and we would n't be here now. 
Additionally, as I 've reapplied, I found out that while 13.5 % was in fact lower than the interest rate overdraft protection account it was replacing, but it is also THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE INTEREST RATE YOU COULD HAVE ON THIS CREDIT LINE. This is an absolute slap in the face. 
Furthermore, while reapplying for the line of credit, I was asked questions regarding military service and whether I was or related to a senior political figure, both of which are fluid topic. Point being I was not asked about this by the loan originator, and it somehow got processed anyway. I was also shown the terms of the line of credit, including fees, penalties, and a lot of other information any reasonable human being would expect to be reviewed prior to the account actually being set up. I was blown away at how thorough the websites process was, and how XXXX employees appear to be offering credit products in a manner that would be unscrupulous at best, and illegal at worst. 
-My second complaint is the fact that US Bank and frankly any financial institution would not have a mechanism in place to manually override these types of issue",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. Bancorp,TN,372XX,,Consent provided,Web,6/27/2016,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,1986038

4/11/2015,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,No notice of investigation status/result,"I sent a letter to TransUnion in XXXX, and received a response today in the mail that they will not be updating my credit report to more accurately represent my profile. The issue arises from the reporting of a "" photo '' radar traffic ticket that I was never made aware of. Upon first seeing this on my credit report, I contacted the City of XXXX regarding this ticket and promptly paid it in full even though I disputed the validity of the ticket, never being sent a notice, or being able to defend it in court. 
The City of XXXX has sent me notices that they have sent a "" Clear Record '' to TransUnion as well. I even have a copy of this "" Clear Record '' that I have forwarded to TransUnion myself. 

Also, TransUnion made agreements with the Attorney General of New York ( though the agreement stipulated nationwide ) about just this type of debt. TransUnion ( and XXXX ) agreed that "" consumer debt that did not arise from a contract '' will no longer be reported. Specific examples mentioned in the agreement were medical debt and traffic related debt. 

Bottom line, this account being listed is in no way an accurate representation of my credit worthiness. Continuing to report this is causing me unnecessary harm. I am only asking that this "" Paid '' debt be removed from my TransUnion credit report. 

I am including a copy of the "" text '' portion of the letter that I sent to TransUnion in XXXX. 

-- -- -- -- -- -- TransUnion XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX TransUnion, This letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting information that you should no longer be. 

I have no doubt that you have a desire to correct and ensure that my credit report shows only accurate information that is also PERTINENT to my credit history. 

The City of XXXX has acknowledged the issues that I have brought up previously, and despite also having sent to me a CLEAR RECORD that I have also already sent to you this debt remains listed. 

Additionally, and for purpose of this follow-up, I write due to a recent settlement that TransUnion entered into with the Attorney General of New York. I demand immediate removal of this "" consumer debt that did not arise from a contract '' be removed from my credit report. My specific issue of receiving a traffic ticket is XXXX specifically mentioned as applying in my case of having no justifiable reason of appearing on my credit report. My claim also has to do with this ticket being of a "" photo '' variety, meaning I never actually RECEIVED a ticket. Based on the settlement that TransUnion entered into, I can speculate that the Attorney General and TransUnion agree with me on the need to have this removed. 

My overall claims of this being valid in the first place also have merit. Either way, I ask for this to be permanently deleted from my report. 

XXXX / City of XXXX - XXXX XXXX # : XXXX, please send me an updated copy of my credit report that reflects this change.

I tried several times for them to take the money out but they kept saying that it was n't going through so they backed out of their agreement with paying {$280.00} to close out the debt. When I called them today they told me that I now owed the full amount because I did n't follow through with the agreement. I told them last Friday that I was waiting for my money to clear in the bank and then I would call them. First of all this debt is from University XXXX XXXX who charged me for classes that I did not even take and I told them several times that I was n't able to access the classes They should have fixed it and unenrolled me from the classes. I am supposed to pay for a service I never received and I do n't think that 's fair. University XXXX XXXX knows that they messed up by not having the classes I signed up for available to me. How can I owe money for a service that was never rendered? And then how can the debt collection agency go back on their word simply because I told them that they 'd have to wait until the money cleared in the bank? This is not fair all the way around,

The website was recognizable as Transunion, so I believed it to be reputable. However, after entering my credit card information ( which appeared to be required to prove identity ) no information or indication was made that I was signing up for a monthly service of $ XXXX. My card was then charged {$1.00} which I was also not made aware of and subsequently 7 days later another charge for {$17.00}. While the service itself may not be a scam, the fashion of non-disclosure that I was "" purchasing '' or "" being charged for a transaction '' was the scam. It may have had an agreement in fine-print, but no where was it clearly indicated that I was signing up or authorizing a purchase for a specific amount. This is a predatory attempt to make money ( like a bait and switch game ) from those attempting to simply apply for a loan. I attempted to contact the company to dispute the charges, but they stated they would not remove me from this re-occurring service. I am therefore reporting this as fraud. 
Here is the website and contact information : XXXX XXXX XXXX is the website for the car loans that directed me to that website : XXXX

1/8/2016,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Communication tactics,Threatened to take legal action,"This complaint supersedes the complaint which I filed against these parties. The complaint involves XXXX parties, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and its collection agency, Collection Bureau of America ( Bureau ). 

Essentially, the Bureau submitted a bill to me containing false statements as to what I had been paid and what I owed due to charges my insurance company disallowed. When I demanded a bill reflecting any adjustments by my insurer, the Bureau refused to provide it and threatened to report me to the credit reporting agencies, as it knew that reporting accurate information would have revealed its fraud. Because these practices appear widespread, an investigation is necessary and enforcement action may be as well. 

The complaint relates to my hospital stay in XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I was treated both in the emergency room and the main hospital. 

I received a bill from XXXX in early XXXX claiming {$5500.00} for services rendered while hospitalized. This bill was the only one I received for a stay in which the total billed amount was in excess of {$120000.00}. I contacted the billing departments for both the emergency room and regular hospital physicians. Both reported that all services had been paid in full. 

I contacted my insurer, advised them of these facts, and asked them to investigate. XXXX reported that it could find no record of a bill rendered by XXXX. 

In the fall of XXXX, I was contacted by an XXXX at the Bureau. She initially claimed that the insurer had not paid the {$5500.00} and that I owed it. In a second call she claimed that I had been paid approximately {$5200.00} and that I owed that. I explained that I wanted a statement of itemized charges together with the insurer 's adjustments. She refused to provide one. 

Thereafter, my insurer and XXXX communicated and discovered the reason for the lack of progress in my investigation. XXXX had reported the charges under a different physician, XXXX XXXX, than the physician reported to me, XXXX XXXX. Hence, when I was asking for information from XXXX, they were not searching under the right name. Based on the records available to XXXX, they advised that {$1100.00} of XXXX claim had been disallowed, and that this fact had been communicated to XXXX. 

Hence the following statements, made through the United States mails and by interstate wire communictions, were false and known to be false by XXXX and the Bureau when made. 

1. That I had been paid {$5500.00}. 
2. That I owed {$5500.00}. 
3. That I owed interest on the {$5500.00}. 

In addition, XXXX and the Bureau 's failure to provide a bill indicating the insurer 's adjustments were made in an effort to conceal conduct that they knew to be unlawful. 

I do not have the ability to scan documents on this computer but I can provide copies if contacted at the cotaqct information below. 

My advice to consumers is twofold. Never accept as true a medical bill that does not reflect the adjustments made by the insurer. And, what originally aroused my suspicion was a bill where all of the entries ended with a zero in the single dollar place. With more than 15 separate entries on the bill, the chances of this happening after action by the insurer are virtually nil.

We are crippled by this debt. When we told, we could not make the high payments, first they suggested consolidating the loans. After consolidation, the payments became even higher. Then, we asked to have them unconsolidated and they refused. it took several phone calls. Also, my wife gets calls almost daily just letting her know a payment is due. The loan has been deferred since she took some classes. They have called her and our mother in law who is the cosigner. The information is inconsistent online and who you talk to in person. and you just get the run around. Today, I was about to make a payment and they refused to take it. They said it has to be a bank card. This was my last straw. I offer to pay the money and you refuse to take payment. This has been a huge nightmare, and this vendor should be barred from taking on student loans. My wife even was diagnosed with XXXX and is not able to work full time. Still, they wo n't offer any relief.

The lack of oversight and attention to security of personal information is quite astounding and scares me. Is there no regulation of how this information is passed? In signing up for a student loan do we give up our privacy rights and the security of our financial information for the foreseeable future? I am appalled and I urge you as a regulatory body to intervene sooner rather than later because the implications of these fast and loose processes are frightening",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Utah System of Higher Education,WA,983XX,,Consent provided,Web,3/16/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,1830246

I submitted offer and they are telling me and my agent that we can not talk to loan short sale processor. I have to go through a liquidation advisor who never returns my call. When he does not return calls I have to talk with someone in the central pool. Now they are telling me that they have 90 days to respond to offer but if I do n't get the bank to sign off on this deal by end of the week the buyer will walk away. It is a very fair offer and I will most likely not get another. While I am trying to get this offer approved they are progressing with foreclosure and one department does not know what the other is doing. I have to move out of home in a month. I will not be able to keep utilities on. XXXX will adversely effect the house if I shut off utilities. They are making it impossible for me and feel that they are pressuring me to just sign home back to bank. Please help

wwhy does n't somebody do some real investigating over there, rather then just ask a deceitful unlawful company. ( probably a XXXX corporation for all we know. Ill tell the hacking on my pc is surely sofisicated., But we wont go there now.mAllow mke to just tell you the facts .... 
Yes. 1. Metlife was paid off for underwriting errors and omission 's XXXX -- XXXX for XXXX for loan # XXXX.

3. XXXX know I had contacted them clearly up to the sale date as to where they were getting back to me. 
XXXX Canceled my homeowners insurance with XXXX just XXXX day after they received their payment XX/XX/XXXX. Not even a month into my said redemption period. 
Redemption period ..hell they deemed my house as abandoned 4 days after the XXXX sale. yes XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent an acquisition of abandonment to the IRS stating that my home had been abandoned. 
So XXXX was probably paid by their securing entity because they do not use the MERS system as an insuring instrument. 
Metlife put in for their claim because they had realized that XXXX Of XXXX Mortgage had done her own underwriting charging us and telling us that XXXX would be do it. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX and owner of XXXX mortgage .absconded with the XXXX from what her title work read. why would the title work of loan amount of XXXX only insure it for XXXX idk.. 
Bottom Line ... this Loan is paid for and probably more then once..Let me know if you 'd like the supporting docs. you have many of them them btw the Note has XXXX dates XXXX & XXXX. JMC charged us XXXX for underwriting ... and she did it. 
From the results that I 've received in the past your workers are not through enough to receive results, that can help me find relief. I guess I 'll just have to seek the newpaper if I want to see some possible results.

When I called to request a refund, they refused to refund claiming the charge is valid. They further complicated the issue by asking me to request the refund in writing from their accounts department which would consider my issue on a case to case basis.

I spoke with XXXX. I have been faithful in my payments and have automated withdrawals from my personal banking account. However, I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX 2015 stating payments would begin posting payments to my account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I was shocked. I had no idea at this time my promissory payments had stopped. I am careful with these payments since I do not want an OFF-set of my taxes! So with this information, I immediately sent documentation to the Federal EDU collection, Acct. Control Technology asking for payment consideration, why they stopped since I have never missed a payment - I asked if the correspondence reached the office and if so, please read the documentation. Oh, did she read it! She was quite aware that not only had I not known about the payments that I had also spent the past 5 months with my helping my mother who had significant and XXXX at The XXXX XXXX Hospital and XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have been taking care of my mother for months as she has been XXXX. My mother 's XXXX was over 10 hours long, extensive and XXXX for a woman of XXXX years old. XXXX So if these particular Customer service representatives try to tell me that they spoke to my mother, they are very mistaken. I am offended and appalled. 
During the conversation, I explained to XXXX I have never once received notice of missing a payment, NSF in bank etc. XXXX then tells me maybe my card had been expired. Then it dawned on me. Yes, my debit card had been replaced with the same # 's and a new expiration date which I told her no one from my bank or their company had contacted me. She ignored me and continued on. She then kept asking if I wanted to begin a new account. I can not believe A NEW account. This was not my fault in the first place. No letter of termination, no financial funds, we are sorry you have defaulted on your promise to pay - NOTHING!!! 
XXXX then stated to me that the representatives had made calls to my phone and to my mother. I hit the ceiling. How can mother speak to anyone - SHE CA N'T. I knew then these people were lying. I offered to have a letter of medical confirmation sent to the department, they refused. XXXX then went to her supervisor who was just as nasty. Kept asking me why I not paid on my account. I explained again it was not that I did not pay, I did NOT know my payments WE 'RE not going through! Again, they told me over and over they spoke to my mother over and over and I know they are lying - I even asked if they knew sign language. I came to a point of cursing which does not making things better. 
I honestly DID NOT know what happened as to WHY they stopped and did n't tell me - WHY they had not called me - I can pull my phone records and prove to them, and lastly why are they accusing my Mother, a XXXX yr. XXXX of LYING - or that my family is lying. 
Can you help me?

XXXX XXXX, 2016 we contacted PennyMac to notify them as I mortgage holder of the damage and obtain instructions on their process requirement. We were provided a Claim Packet outlining the document that we must submit upon receipt of their letter. XXXX XXXX, 2016 we received XXXX checks from XXXX XXXX. We endorsed the checks per the instructions of PennyMac mailed the check to them. XXXX XXXX, 2016 the checks were returned to us by PennyMac. We have a second mortgage and because XXXX XXXX had not endorsed the checks. Nothing in PennyMac suggests, states or instruct us that we should first obtain XXXX XXXX 's endorsement on the checks prior to sending them to PennyMac. We mailed to checks to XXXX XXXX for endorsement and was asked if we wanted them to mail directly to PennyMac? All that they required is that we provide them with a letter and the address and account number with PennyMac and they would XXXX the check to PennyMac Loss Draft Services at the address provided. Why could n't PennyMac have taken this same approach and avoided such a long delay? I personally made at least there ( 3 ) subsequent phone calls to PennyMac asking if they had all the documents that they needed and was told yes each time. 
XXXX XXXX, 2016, PennyMac received the check from XXXX XXXX and they have been stuck on 2-3 days to process ever since no matter what you asked regarding the status or when will they disbursed the first check so that the contractor start on the repairs on our home. 
XXXX XXXX, 2016, PennyMac mailed a letter to us informing us that they do not have all of the documents needed to set up a draw to initiate repairs. It will take 2-3 days to review all of the documentation that they have had since XX/XX/XXXX with the exception of the check from XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX, 2016, I phoned PennyMac to once again inquire about the status of our claim as to when could we expect to see the first disbursement check? Response. They are still reviewing the documents which will take 2-3 business days. After their review it will take 2-3 business days to setup the account. Then another 2-3 business days before a check would be mailed by XXXX, two day delivery. XXXX XXXX, 2016, we received a letter from PennyMac "" the account is currently being reviewed to determine eligibility for disbursement. '' A second paragraph states "" we are currently conducting a full review of the loan as it relates to the request. The account is currently being reviewed to determine eligibility for disbursement. '' What loan, we are not applying for a loan we just want funds that XXXX XXXX provided us for the repair of our home to be released so that our contractor can began work. What I have found to be a certainty with regards to PennyMac when you call, ALL of their employees will say 2-3 business days throughout the conversation regardless of what the situation. Documents being reviewed and will take XXXX business days. PennyMac 's ridiculous process for receiving insurance funds/draws to make repairs to our home is facing a robber and held up by the PennyMac. Their process for property lost claims over XXXX using a restricted escrow account causes extreme delays in the repairs process. These delays cause a tremendous amount of stress, time and money. PennyMac requires you to be at XXXX % complete after the initial draw using only XXXX of the funds. Then you are required to meet a XXXX % with the next draw of XXXX. In other words you will need to be 90 % complete to get XXXX of your money.

Then It was sold to a XXXX party collection agency, named XXXX XXXX on XXXX. XXXX XXXX sent me a collection letter, I responded to their letter with in the 30 day. The amount was {$830.00} and {$560.00}. The {$560.00} was part of the {$830.00}, but was reported as XXXX account ; this time. I disputed this to the credit bureau, and it was removed. This company also has different account number at the time. 

XXXX XXXX reported as service dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for {$560.00} by account number XXXX Letter dated on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I contacted them and disputed with the three credit Bureau and was removed. XXXX used the same account number as XXXX XXXX, XXXX, original complaint, with the knowledge of this account is removed from my credit after dispute. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I got my credit pulled through annual credit report, and I found out about the XXXX negative report by XXXX. I dispute it over the line the same day, but the system would n't let me to finish, so i called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to continue the dispute, few weeks letter i called I found out it was gone, the XXXX XXXX, XXXX negative report does n't show anymore, but then was new report, dating XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I called to ask. The representative is telling me, we never have XXXX XXXX, XXXX in our system and she was very rude, I said, I disputed it on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for the XXXX XXXX, XXXX, how can I dispute for a future time to be reported on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX?, what is going on, did XXXX have someone in the department helping them to tamper consumer account? I am having difficulty to understand what goes on at Equifax Department? All of this to help XXXX. 
XXXX, reported on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; for the amount of {$560.00}, {$180.00} and {$180.00}. I explained to Equifax representative that, this was removed many times before ; why is it showing in my credit as newly reported? She said, dispute it, I said, how many times should I dispute it, see the history? I have been disputing an account that was removed over and over again? Why are you accepting the same bill by the same collection agency after i reported your department that this collection agency is reporting fraudulentlyThis account that is opened as new on XXXX XXXX, XXXX is the same account that was reported over the years by XXXX, by XXXX, by XXXX and XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. Each time I disputed and luck of verification it was removed from my account successfully. But not for long, XXXX will take over again by updating the reported date, the amount and the account number as new. If that does n't work they sell it or transferred to the affiliated collections as XXXX and interstate. 

For how long should I fight and dispute for the same bill? This time Equifax is in their side, for some reason, Equifax representative seem to sympathize with XXXX and are refusing to remove it unless I give them a new police report. I was told, if XXXX decides to report this again and again and every month ; all they needed for verification from them is my name my address and the amount, if they provide this ; the say we are good, but you if you are disputing it you must provide as with new police report, so they are refusing to remove it knowing. I was told the police report I gave them on XX/XX/XXXX does n't exist, she is saying, we do n't keep history. Many histories that show as removed from my account is also not showing. 
So, i was forced to findout about the state law, i called to attorney general ; i found out by law they should keep it for seven years. 

This type of behavior is dishonest, abusive and caused harm to my credit history and my financial as business owner. I suffered emotionally and financially over the years. I have to spent hours of my time. Equifax is

Upon submitting the payment, I received notification that the payment was received. Prior to leaving on vacation on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I called US Bank automated phone service to confirm the payment was in fact received. On XXXX XXXX, while on vacation, I notice that the payment had not been withdrawn from my bank account. Therefore, I called US Bank to confirm when the payment would be withdrawn. During the call, I was informed that my payment was return by my bank due to the account number not being provided. I immediately reviewed the online payment history and it showed that payment was received, as well as my bank account and routing number. I called US Bank again informing them that the online payment shows that account number was provided. During my second call, I was told that XXXX returned my payment. I called XXXX to obtain the reason for my payment being returned. XXXX stated that my payment was never submitted to them and therefore, they did not return the payment. I called US Bank again, and submitted a formal compliant, as I could not obtain a consistent reason as to why my payment was shown in my online payment history as received on XXXX XXXX, 2016 at XXXX and the automated phone system stated payment was received on XXXX XXXX, 2016, but customer service is stating that payment has not been received. As part of the complaint, I asked US Bank to waiver all XX/XX/XXXX late fees, as the payment could have been resubmitted in a timely manner has their online banking system or automated phone system indicated that the payment was Not received. Upon submitting the complaint, I also mailed a check for the mortgage amount. Per discussion with US Bank on XXXX XXXX, I was informed that although a complaint had been submitted and the Bank was researching the issue the payment was still considered late. I informed US Bank that a additional payment was made via normal mail. The Bank stated that it can take 7-10 days for the payment to be processed upon receipt. In addition, while I was waiting to receive notification from US Bank regarding the outcome of their investigation, US Bank proceeded to report the late payment on my credit report. US Bank current practices provide customers with false/incorrect information causing the customer to incur penalties and late fees. US Bank online service and automated phone service reports payments received, even if there is an error with the submission of the payment. Had I been aware during the time of payment or when confirming the payment was received via the automated phone system, I could have resubmitted the payment in a timely manner. In addition, the communication method ( normal mail ) used by US Banks, decreases the amount of time a customer has to resolve an issues. The Bank indicated that they were made aware of the error on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and a letter was send via normal mail on that day. Additionally, US Bank noted that they attempted to call me on XXXX XXXX ( one time ) to inform me of the issue. However, I have not recorded of this call. I have called US Bank over 6 times to resolved the issues. Additionally, on XXXX XXXX 2016 while attempting to make my XXXX mortgage payment, I was informed that any payment made would go towards the XX/XX/XXXX balance. Therefore, the XX/XX/XXXX payment would then be considered late. Per the company policies, customers will incur a fee for all return checks. Therefore, I am unable to cancel the XX/XX/XXXX check that was previously via normal mail and pay both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX over the phone, as I will incur a fee for a return check. I would like for US Bank to remove the 30 day late notice on my credit report, as I have made several attempts to resolve the matter and identify the error.

The suit was filed in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX was not aware that the suit had escalated to the point of a bank levy, which was withdrawn from XXXX 's bank account out XX/XX/XXXX without prior notification. The levy included the amount owed, interest, attorney fees, and court fees. The total amount being sued is almost double the amount owed. 

Since the withdrawal of the levy in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX has been attempting to contact XXXX with the assistance of his daughter, XXXX XXXX, in the hopes of resolving the case. 

XXXX can not be reached directly through the number provided. Representatives of his firm answers the phone and the representative explicitly states that they can not provide a number to which he can directly be reached. Representative does not state what position they hold in the firm. When XXXX requested to speak to an attorney directly or for direct phone number, representative stated they can not put in such request giving the reason that the attorneys are either very busy or are out of the office on business. Since XXXX was not initially aware of what the case was about or even how the levied came about, request for more case information and documents was denied by representative. The representative told XXXX the only way to access court documents was to request it from directly from the court. When XXXX asked for any options for the levy to be returned to the bank account, representative denied any other option other than paying them in full for the sued amount. Representative did not make it known that a claim of exemption was available. Recordings of phone conversations with representatives are recorded by the firm. 

XXXX was able to get court documents directly from the court. After examining the documents, it can be noted that the proof of debt did not include list of transactions that was not paid. The proof consisted of a bill that already had the accumulated amount with past due dates. After doing some research, XXXX found that a claim of exemption may be filed for a return of the levy and was filed shortly thereafter. 

On the day of the hearing to determine the claim of exemption, XXXX was not present. After the judge heard each side, judge approved for a partial return of the levy. XXXX stated that other potential resolution in regards to the case could be made by communicating to the other party outside the courtroom. After greeting the other party outside, the other party stated she was a representing lawyer that the firm occasionally hired. The representing lawyer also stated since she is not the attorney assigned to the case, she could not answer any questions that XXXX XXXX had. After leaving the courthouse, XXXX made a call to the firm to see how else to resolve the case. The representative stated since they have not received any information from the court, they could not answer any questions. When requesting to have firm call XXXX back once they receive court information, they rejected request stating that the firm is too busy to make any call backs.

The manager agreed that the 24 month was better at a "" low rate of 2.09 % '' and even better, I did n't have to make my first payment until XX/XX/XXXX. I asked if I had to give a down payment as I usually do and he said it was n't necessary. When XX/XX/XXXX came around, I logged into my account to check how much the payment was so that I can send the payment. The website said the minimum payment was {$290.00} so I proceeded to send the payment. I have made 4 payments since then but this last time, I was curious as to why my balance was {$5000.00} if my initial purchase was {$5800.00} and I had made {$1200.00} in payments. I logged in online and looked at my last time and to my surprise I was being charged over {$100.00} in interest each month. I quickly called customer service for clarification. The representative verified that I was on the standard 24 month term "" at a low 24.99 % ''. I told her that I was told 2.09 % and she quickly responded that it IS 2.09 % a month. I told her that I felt deceived when I was told 2.09 % because interest rates on credit cards are supposed to be disclosed as APR. She said there was nothing they could do. She advised that they could make an exception and if I was willing to put the 20 % down they would give me 0 % and what was left if I were to have done the 12 month term to begin with and that my monthly payment would go up to over {$500.00}. I feel as though they deceived me into thinking that the 2.09 % was the annual rate so I would be comfortable with the payments on a larger purchase than what I initially wanted to make. Had they disclosed the rate properly as 24.99 % APR I would have been able to make a more appropriate decision or made a smaller purchase that would appropriately fit my budget. Now, since I can no longer return the item, I either have to pay over {$2000.00} of interest over the 24 month term or switch to the 12 months and not only have to pay the 20 % which is {$1000.00} and have my monthly payments go over {$500.00}. I feel that their practices are unfair and deceptive to consumers and that they should correct this immediately. I do n't know who in the right mind would say that 24.99 % is a low rate. I believe that they should honor the 2.09 % as the APR since they deceitfully lead me to believe that they were quoting the APR as ALL lenders disclose credit card rates using APR.

Enrollment in paperless statements requires consent for purposes of XXXX, which I did not provide. Accordingly, Capital One is violating XXXX by enrolling me without my consent. Further, TILA does not permit creditors to condition delivery of periodic statements on paperless enrollment. As such, failure to send a paper statement in the absence of XXXX consent constitutes a violation of TILA 's periodic statement rules.

Please answer the following questions : a. If XXXX owns the Note, what was the date that the company took ownership? 
b. If XXXX owns the Note, why is there no assignment on file in my County Clerk 's Office for the date of change of ownership of the Security Deed? 
c. Has the Promissory Note been separated from the Security Deed? 
d. Did Wells Fargo give XXXX Power of Attorney to service my loan, including carrying out foreclosure? 
e. Does Wells Fargo own the Note? 
f. Please note that I am not asking about the assignment dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX of servicing rights from Wells Fargo to XXXX attached in my supporting documents. What concerns me is that transfer was not accompanied by a new Assignment of the Security Deed from Wells Fargo to XXXX, XXXX, or to XXXX Trust. Where are those Assignments? 
g. Has the Original Promissory Note been lost? I have read in research about reckless mishandling and lost foundational loan documents in the merger from Wachovia to Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX

They have continuously called various relatives and non relatives telling them that I am going to be held in contempt of court for not contacting them about the disputed bills. Just today, they called my aging mother, my son, and my ex-husband 's wife (? ) saying that I was going to get arrested if I did n't get in contact with them immediately. I spent my entire lunch hour assuring the people that I love that nothing was going to happen to me. 

This company is very scary and has the tact of an ape. They call at all hours of the day and night. They XXXX called my old job and did n't stop calling till I told them XXXX times that I would get fired for taking their calls at work. 

I have denied owing money to them for years and have told them repeatedly to stop calling me and my family, friends, and place of employment. 

I feel that they were given my medical information in error. No collection agency should have been given my medical financial information. 

This company has filed an account on my credit report, even though I disputed this account, yet it stayed on my record and they continue to harass me every day.

10/30/2015,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was granted credit of {$2500.00} by Carecredit/GE Money. I made four additional transactions of {$1400.00}. Based on high monthly due minimum, after eight years of steady payments I look confident to have paid off this credit. But, every month I see this credit increasing due to crafty billing by Creditor. For example : they charged systematically high so-called Interests on Purchases even when no transaction was made in related billing circle. Moreover Carecredit lured me to sign four years ago a program called ACCOUNTS SECURITY PROGRAM which charged my account of {$36.00} or more a month. I was told the program main purpose was to help credit holder compensate monthly due minimum payments in case of sick leave or jobless time. Just a big lie! Because when I recently moved from XXXX to XXXX and while I am still jobless and struggling to settle here, I wrote several times to Carecredit and Synchrony Bank to claim they activate benefit of my account Security program during this jobless period, nothing. Instead they have not only jeopardized my credit score but also connected all my phones to debt collectors who are, as of today, harassing me by calling any time 7X7 days. In the light of all of above, from XX/XX/XXXX I finally stopped paying monthly due minimum unless this creditor provide me in writing complete credit account billing and payments history from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to help me know how much I so far paid compared with current balance credit.

7/10/2015,Consumer Loan,Vehicle lease,Managing the loan or lease,,"I had a lease through Volkswagen Credit. I was unfortunately in XXXX different car accidents this year ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and the XXXX accident totaled my car. It was declared a total loss. My biggest concern is that I am being charged for things that I am not responsible for ; like excise taxes and payments that were covered by GAP insurance. The town I live in has told me that VW credit handles tax abatements in cases like mine or similar and VW has informed me that I should pay them ( VW ) for taxes and then get an abatement from my town hall in XXXX, MA. I have learned that it is not my responsibility to pay the excise taxes because the car was totaled, I am only responsible for the insurance deductible amount stated in my policy. 
Not only have I been billed in excess of these, I have been charged late fees as well. My credit is being reported to incorrectly as though I am late and not paying my lease payments on time. 
The car was totaled in XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, before any payments were due that month. My car insurance and XXXX have already worked out a settlement and my GAP coverage has paid what should have satisfied the lease agreement entirely, leaving me with only a {$500.00} deductible remaining. Instead I am being billed over {$1000.00} ( {$1000.00} ) for supposed past due amounts and late fees as well as excise taxes for XX/XX/XXXX. 
As I said earlier, this was the XXXX accident this year, and I also had a payment agreement which deferred the payments from when my car was being repaired to the end of my lease. I did not have my car for over XXXX months, and was unable to make the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX payments, or it was the XXXX and XXXX payments which were the deferred ones. Never the less, the GAP coverage was responsible for paying these, as it was through my auto insurance and I was current on all payments at the time the car was totaled. 
XXXX I have had to pay extra money to make payments through XXXX or XXXX XXXX. And I was still reported as late on my credit reports. I made the payments needed to satisfy the deferment for my account. Also since it was declared a loss before the payment due date the month of the XXXX accident I should not owe a payment for that month. And once again, the town I live in has said it is VW who applies for the tax abatement and not me. 
Please help as there are so many issues here and I can not seem to get anywhere with them. 
Once again these issues are:1. Excise taxes which I am being told to pay and then apply for an abatement for. 
2. GAP coverage that was already settled, yet I am being billed more than my share of it, which should be only my deductible amount, or {$500.00}. 
3. Late payments being reported when I have copies of my deferment agreement and have made payments to satisfy that agreement. 
4. Late fees that I am being charged, when it was solely between VW Credit and XXXX XXXX XXXX what the negotiated and final payment amount would be. VW has received this payment and are still billing me for more than I am liable for or responsible for. 
5. It is my credit being ruined, and not for late or missing payments, only false late fees on payments already made, deferred or never due.

I notified Capital One and spoke to XXXX different people confirming the matter. I was advised I would not be charged for it and the charges would come off my card. They did and a new credit card with a new credit card number was sent to me. The case was then closed. Fast forward to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and I received adjustments on my new card of over {$1100.00} for those same charges!!! I called as soon as I saw that and after XXXX minutes and no less than XXXX representatives, I got nowhere. I received XXXX different answers and a promise that a manager would call me to resolve this by the next day. No one called. I then tried resolving via online chat to no avail. That rep told me managers do not call customers ... I demanded to speak to their manager via chat who was of NO help. He refused to give me their legal department 's contact information and told me I have to call in ( again ). I told him repeatedly that I do NOT have time to waste another 40+ minutes for their mistake in which they are now reporting that balance to the credit reporting agencies. He would not assist and kept repeating I must call in. I made it very clear I was going to resort to a complaint with the CFPB as I can not repay {$1100.00} that I do not have. I am a XXXX person with medical bills that must be paid or I die. I am devastated by all of this and just want it resolved. Capital One will NOT address the matter. They claim a letter was mailed ... I never got a letter. They will not resolve via phone ... I keep getting transferred or told I need to call back or placed on hold for large periods of time.

I called XXXX, and requested a transfer. Instead of doing what I requested, they opened a new account and left the old account active. I did n't realize this at first and started receiving notice for late payments. I would pay them, thinking I had made a mistake, and the next month I would receive a late statement for the alternate account. Many months later I realized the different account numbers, inquired to find the issue, and called the company. After many phone calls and emails, my complaint was sent up through their company for review. They came back apologizing, gave me a check for the wrongful charges, and assured me that both accounts would be closed. For a few years I heard nothing, then XX/XX/XXXX, a collection agency AFNI contacted me to inform me that I owed them {$350.00} for and account I had with XXXX. The same account that was fraudulently created. I called XXXX and emailed a complaint. I got a response back again admitting it was an error, and saying that AFNI would be informed and called off.

To this inquiry I was given no response. 

As a law firm specializing in debt collection practices, there is no excuse for the flagrant disregard for federal and state laws of which the staff of ARNOLD SCOTT HARRIS engaged in, or the deliberate attempt of his staff to conceal their identity and role in the illegal activities of what is an unethical attempt to prevent complaint filing.

4/29/2015,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I am filing a complaint due to the issue of my mortgage bank being uncooperative with me in order to settle up on my payments and avoid foreclosure on my home. Fives years ago the co-owner and I split up and he left the home. He cut all ties financially with me and quit his job making it difficult for me to keep up on payments. I applied for a hardship program through XXXX a little over a year after we split. But it still was difficult and eventually I was unable to make payments and provide for my children. Last year my mortgage was bought out by Caliber Home Loans. They sent me a payment agreement consisting of interest only payment with escrowed insurance and taxes. I was interested in this of course. When I contacted them they informed me that the co-owner had to sign the agreement also. I informed them of my situation and they still would not work with just me on saving my home. Because myself and co-owner were not married there was no distribution of property when the relationship was dissolved. I was left with all the bills and providing for the child we have in common. Again two weeks ago on XXXX XXXX I contacted them concerning the possible foreclosure and my application of loss mitigation. I provided them with everything I could. The only document they were missing and required was a signed letter from the co-owner stating he would sign the modification. Which they were well aware of in my application letter that he refused to do due to going through family issues concerning child support. With all this information I believe that Caliber should assist me without the consent of the co-owner as I am the one still living in the home and paying the bills. The ending result as of XXXX XXXX the courts have granted the bank counsels motion to appoint a referee and grant a judgment of foreclosure. I do not want to lose my home that I share with my children. The only home my son, the child we share, has ever lived in.

I have NEVER missed a payment up to this day. Approx 12 months ago, a Cease and Desist Order was placed on this account by me which was repeatedly ignored by CBWW causing me to purchase extra features on my phone in order to Block Calls from CBWW. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I was served a lawsuit by CBWW demanding full payment to the tune of {$1700.00} despite only owing {$900.00} at this time. Several attempts to request ANY copies of me acknowledging owing this bill AND copies of ANY payment arrangements signed by me have not been provided. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I spoke via telephone to a CBWW employee named XXXX who admitted that I never signed ANY paperwork accepting responsibility for this bill AND she ALSO admitted that I never signed ANY payment arrangement with CBWW. AFTER I was served, the CBWW actually cashed ANOTHER check from me for {$35.00}. These creditors are being paid every month and are even cashing my checks AFTER I was served!! This lawsuit is illegal and unnecessary causing me an additional {$600.00} bucks plus almost 2 years of interest which is an outrageous illegal scam to rack up fees to purposely keep me in debt. This collection company has a systemic fraudulent office practice of knowingly racking up debtors cases when the total due amount gets lower than {$1000.00} purposely causing debtors to represent themselves in civil court, where they often lose and BINGO another {$600.00} bucks is added to their file.

10/6/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, my family lost our beautiful home to a house fire XXXX. Since then, we still have not broken ground on the rebuild. Between Virginia Properties Insurance and Wells Fargo, we have not been able to start rebuilding our life. Instead, we are a family of XXXX stuck in an apartment with no hopes of seeing our home as it was before the fire. Not only have we not seen a dime from our insurance agency with respects to our inventory/belongings, the check that we received to rebuild our home is held in limbo with Wells Fargo. The situation is this : when we tried to deposit the insurance money for the rebuild into a Wells Fargo account, they wanted to us to go through a long documentation process in order to endorse the check to pay the contractors. XXXX of the requirements is for us to show a signed contractors contract. In order to have a contract we need building plans. Our building plans were destroyed by the owner of VA XXXX XXXX some years ago and XXXX XXXX of XXXX does n't have a copy. So we are forced to pay for building plans which are XXXX dollars. We ca n't pay for the building plans because Wells Fargo is holding the money hostage. We have spoken to them several times and it seems as if we 're going nowhere. Is there anyone or anyway XXXX on your side could help us with this process. We are at a loss and do n't know how we can get back into our home. 

A little history : prior to our house fire, we had Virginia Properties Insurance because we had XXXX water damage claims within 5 years. This caused our regular insurance company to drop us and there was only XXXX or XXXX insurance company 's that would give us a policy at an extremely inflated cost. Not only was it very expensive, but it only covered the house in extreme circumstances and the max that we could possibly get for the entire house to be rebuilt is only $ 200K. We owe more than that and the house costs more than that to rebuild. The inventory ( furniture, clothes, etc. ) maxes out at $ XXXX. The insurance does not cover living expenses, so while we are paying for the apartment while the house is unlivable, we also have to pay mortgage. This has been very hard on our family. The property insurance XXXX as well as the insurance company dragged their feet on every step of the process. So when we received the check a few weeks ago, we were ecstatic, thinking that we were about to get the work on our house started, however, when we went into the local wells fargo bank, they told us about this process to endorse the check for deposit. 

Please help our family. We are on the verge of bankruptcy trying to keep us XXXX households and working hard to try to get the process done. It was our house and we paid our mortgage to wells fargo every month, but now we are being made to feel as if we are trying to get something out of the deal that we do n't deserve. They are treating us like we are con artists. We just want our house back. We want to go back to what our XXXX children know and were familiar with. Meanwhile, our burnt house is just there in the neighborhood, where other kids play, an eyesore for our neighbors, getting worse every time is rains and collecting citations from XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX who by the way are saying that if action is n't taken within the next few days, they will demolish the structure and charge us XXXX dollars after doing so ).

His voice & demeanor changed & he said, "" Oh, so you 're just not going to pay it. That 's a moral issue. Where are you 're morals?

I asked what my student loan payments would be if I consolidated all of my students loans with XXXX servicing center and was initially told that payments would be between $ XXXX {$400.00}. At the time, I realized that I had many student loans and this would work for me. After completing the paper work, I was sent notification that I qualified for Income Based Repayment and that my payments would be approximately $ XXXX, a little more than I expected, which I accepted. I then received notification from XXXX that I had additional students loans and made arrangements to have those loans consolidated with the other loans through Fed Loan Servicing Center. In the meantime, I put my loans in forbearance and was scheduled to begin payments in XXXX XXXX but realized that my payments had increased from $ XXXX to $ XXXX. After speaking with several customer service representatives and XXXX supervisors, I was told by XXXX, the last supervisor ( ID # XXXX ) with whom I spoke, that the increase was because the servicing center had initially put my loans in the wrong program. I spoke with a customer service representative who admitted this ; however, I do n't think that she was supposed to admit it since I had spoken with XXXX customer service representative and a supervisor before her who did not indicate that a mistake had been made. XXXX admitted it only after I had spoken with her and demanded that she forward me to a supervisor. I was told that I did not qualify for Income Based Repayment because of a {$6000.00} Parent PLUS Loan that was included in the initial consolidation and that my account was put into the Income Contingent Program when the additional loans were added and Fed Loan Servicing recognized their mistake. I did not receive notification of this initial mistake. I did ask that the servicing center choose the lowest payment program in my initial application but would not have agreed to these terms because I can not afford it. I knew the payment would increase but I assumed it would be based on the Income Based Repayment program and that it would not almost double. I have asked if I can appeal the terms of the loan consolidation since Fed Loan Servicing admits they made a mistake and was told there is nothing they can do. They offered to continue to put my loans in forbearance ( every 90 days for 3 years ) until I can afford to pay the $ XXXX. I also asked that this company work on having customer service representatives provide accurate information and was told that they were sorry I had not be given the correct information. I would like to have the Parent PLUS Loan removed from the terms of my consolidation loan so that I can qualify for the Income Based Repayment program on the remaining loans.",,AES/PHEAA,LA,704XX,,Consent provided,Web,6/7/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,1957571

1/21/2016,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I made an on-line purchase for pillows totaling {$49.00}. I charged this to my Macy's/XXXX XXXX Credit Card , which was recently sent to me as a replacement for my original Macy 's issued card. Following this, I awaited receipt of a bill from Macy 's so that I could pay the correct amount owed on time as I have consistently done in the past. HOWEVER, I NEVER RECEIVED A BILL FROM MACY 'S. I would have gladly paid the amount I owed in XXXX, but since I never received a bill as I had in the past, I was unaware of the fact that this bill was outstanding. I have subsequently learned that Macy 's made "" recent upgrades with their online payment system '' on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The result was that I never again received any statement, invoice or notice about the outstanding charges either by email or paper statements, from XXXX through XXXX 2015. To clarify, I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY EMAIL MESSAGES OR E-STATEMENTS OR PAPER ACCOUNT STATEMENT FROM MACY 'S INDICATING THAT I HAD ANY OUTSTANDING CHARGES OR LATE FEES SINCE THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE IN XXXX. 

On XXXX XXXX, almost five months later, I finally received a bill from Macy 's for {$190.00} [ {$140.00} of this being late charges ] and was told my account was now in collection. I called to inquire about this outrageous bill ; the customer service representative was less than helpful. She told me that even though Macy 's never sent me any bills or notices, that this was somehow my fault and that there was nothing she could do to help sort out this problem. I asked to speak to a manager and she said she would note that and ask that someone call me. She also stated that I had agreed to receive notices via email, which I do not recall doing. In fact, there is nothing on the Macy 's online account website that allows customers to make this choice. 

On XXXX XXXX, I made a payment over the phone for the total balance I originally owed -- {$51.00} -- and a different CS rep agreed to waive two months of late fees, which was the limit of her authority. 

My balance according to Macy 's remains at {$73.00} in late fees. THIS IS STILL UNACCEPTABLE. Macy 's supposed "" upgrades '' to its billing system appear to have caused the termination of any communications with me or issuance of any monthly statements. Instead, the new system initiated the assessment of late charges at an alarming rate, without any knowledge on my part. 

I believe it is totally deceptive and unfair for Macy 's to charge me such excessive fees due to Macy 's own failure to send me a bill or notify me until now. This new system appears to be designed to ensure that extravagant late charges are applied without the customer being notified of them. 

Further, several of the online guidance items entitled "" How do I add my Macy 's Credit Card to my existing macys.com profile? And "" How can I dispute a charge on my Macy 's Credit Card? '' which evidently are administered through yet a fourth corporation, Department Stores National Bank, do not work and did not allow me access to complete any of these functions online in the past few days.

1/12/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"I regularly use Chase Bank 's ATM and Branch deposit services but today I decided to try out their Chase Mobile phone app to deposit a check. With all three services the wording is nearly identical on any disclaimers. Essentially "" deposit by the cutoff time and your deposit will be processed that day. Funds will be made available within 24 hours. Any holds placed on the account can affect funds availability. '' With both ATM and XXXX deposits, courtesy funds are made available to the account until the checking funds come through. This is not mentioned anywhere on the deposit slips but has happened every time I have ever deposited via ATM or Branch over the course of several years. There is nothing to indicated when depositing a check through Mobile that it is different from ATM and Branch deposits and courtesy funds are NOT made available. In addition, if you should decide ( say because you are mad about the deception around courtesy funds ) to cancel the deposit, you 'll then learn that you can not cancel deposits placed via Mobile. Again nothing prior to placing the deposit via Mobile mentions these sharp differences between Mobile and ATM or Branch deposits. ( No courtesy funds, no ability to cancel deposits ). The only advice I received from speaking to Chase reps was to essentially present the check at another bank with faster processing which would then force cancel the Mobile deposit as a 2nd presentation. I feel there should be specific wording clarifying the differences between Chase Mobile Deposits and their ATM & Branch deposits. Namely that courtesy funds will NOT be available and it is NOT possible to cancel a deposit once initiated.

12/8/2015,Credit card,,Customer service / Customer relations,,"I had not used my Citi credit card since XX/XX/XXXX. In the time since XX/XX/XXXX, I was issued a new card ; however I never activated the card. Nevertheless, an unauthorized charge was made on my card without my knowledge in XX/XX/XXXX. Following receiving a notice that I had a delinquent balance in XX/XX/XXXX, I inquired about the balance with Citi and disputed it. Citi found in my favor on the dispute and reversed the charges including late fees and interest in XX/XX/XXXX. However, in XX/XX/XXXX I discovered that they had reported negative information in my credit report. I called Citi again to fix the issue, and they apologized and told me they would get the reporting fixed and I would receive notice in 5-7 days when it was complete. I simultaneously disputed the negative information with the reporting agencies. Over a month passed, I received no update from Citi ; however the credit reporting agencies noted that Citi had indicated that the negative information was in fact accurate. I called Citi again to try to remedy the situation. The first customer service representative was apologetic and told me that it looked like it had gotten lost in bureaucracy, but that she would get her manager to help. The manager was very rude, indicated that I did not deserve any notice of their actions regarding fixing their credit reporting despite the promises previously made, and also indicated that the charge was in fact authorized and proper despite Citi 's previous finding in my favor and that the card was not even activated. While I have not incurred any actual losses yet ; my credit score dropped by about XXXX points, which is concerning because I am trying to buy a house and secure a mortgage. 

The supporting documents attached show that my last activity was in XX/XX/XXXX, no payments were made recently, but the balances were cleared, the negative information in all credit reports, and the results of my initial dispute with Citi in which Citi found in my favor.

XXXX XXXX my dad XXXX XXXX decided to purchase hearing aides using Wells Fargo Financial Bank ( WFFB ). My XXXX year old dad 's memory is n't as good as it use to be. 

He setup up automatic bill payments/withdrawals monthly, from his XXXX checking account # XXXX ( last XXXX numbers of checking account ) for {$600.00} a month, to start XXXX XXXX. An improper address was entered and that check was returned. On XXXX XXXX dad authorized XXXX to send a {$600.00} check directly to WFFB, received on XXXX XXXX. WFFB assessed him a late fee. Meanwhile dad wrote another {$600.00} check payment that was received on XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX dad was frustrated and authorized someone at XXXX or WFFB to pay off the balance of {$5400.00}. This was done by an ACH payment. Then on XXXX XXXX dad wrote a check for {$5400.00}. Payments WFFB received are : XXXX XXXX {$600.00} written check # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX automatic bill pay from XXXX, # XXXX XXXX XXXX {$5400.00} dad 's phone authorization to XXXX to pay via ACH to WFFB XXXX XXXX {$5400.00} dad 's authorization to someone to pay outstanding balance # XXXX Total payments {$12000.00} Less : original balance -XXXX This is a 0 % loan for the first 12 months. 

Overpayment {$6000.00} On XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX phoned WFFB asking when he will receive a refund. The Representative told him it would be 45-60 days. Dad believes a check can be written in a few business days. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX was greatly irritated that he has to wait 2 months. XXXX with dad on the phone, called WFFB and talked with an initial Rep. We asked if an ACH could be processed. The Rep did not know what is an ACH. We then talked with a Service Manager named ( XXXX XXXX, in XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). We explained the account is overpaid and we want our money back via an ACH. XXXX insisted this can not be done. XXXX asked why not since Wells Fargo easily takes in money using ACH. XXXX said their payments department has to review payments received. XXXX stated that the automatic phone balance announcement said there is a credit on the account. XXXX asked why an ACH can not be processed. XXXX restated policy of 45-60 days using a physical check. XXXX said this is causing him financial stress given federal taxes that are due. XXXX then asked to talk with XXXX ' supervisor. XXXX said there is none. XXXX asked for name of the VP of this division. XXXX stated there is no one here with that title. XXXX then asked to speak with another senior manager. XXXX said there is none. Finally XXXX asked for their mailing address. XXXX gave us : Wells Fargo Retail Services/Financial Bank, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX reiterated there is a credit balance over payment, and XXXX stated there is one ; therefore why ca n't XXXX or another Service Manager issue a rapid refund? XXXX held fast that they can not refund money. 

Clearly this is WFFB 's efforts to hold on to excess funds for as long as possible. By listening to XXXX on the phone, it is evident he is elderly. Yet WFFB has made no attempts to assist an elderly customer. 

DESIRE RESOLUTION : We request that WFFB issue an ACH of {$6000.00} back into the XXXX checking account # XXXX ( last XXXX numbers of checking account ) within 10 working days of receipt of this complaint. 


Please phone, mail or e-mail us your response to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Ph : XXXX E-mail : XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX 's email ) PS : copy of this complaint has been sent to the Wells Fargo : Wells Fargo Retail Services/Financial Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX

To make matters worse, they transferred the loan for my residence which had more repair funds than it should have assigned to my residence loan. Because of quality issues and significant delays on the part of the roofing contractor I used for XXXX properties, I held back some of the checks from the contractor and they expired. I have called and spoken with XXXX multiple times and also wrote letters requesting they reissue the checks as they had verbally said they would do on multiple occasions but never did until I submitted a complaint to the CFPB or threatened to do so.

4/13/2015,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"We are the poster children for the real estate crash -- we purchased in XXXX at the top of the market, put 25 % down ( {$150000.00} ) and our rate on the 1st mortgage was 5.875 % ( 6 month Libor ARM with XXXX XXXX ). XXXX would not allow a short sale nor would they reduce the rate on our Libor ARM ( imagine the profit over 10 years -- Libor Index under 1 % and we were paying almost 6 % ). 
In XXXX we needed to make repairs to the house. I was unemployed at the time so my husband obtained a HELOC from XXXX in his name only ( I was only on the title ). Servicing was later transferred to XXXX. We struggled for years to make the payments and in XXXX attempted to short sale our home ( due to large reduction in both our incomes ). The 1st mortgage was with XXXX XXXX ( but investor was also XXXX ). We were declined for short sale ( investor XXXX would not approve ). Ironically we had no trouble getting an offer on the HELOC to settle for {$7500.00} -- but only if the first mortgage holder would agree -- also XXXX. We could not afford to keep making payments on HELOC and the 1st so we stopped payment making the payment on the HELOC in XXXX. The HELOC was charged off by XXXX about 6 months later. 
In XXXX XXXX with another 24 months in payments and the increase in real estate values we again listed our home for sale in the hopes of paying off the first with XXXX and settling with XXXX on the HELOC. Right after we listed for sale, we got notification that the charged off loan had been transferred again -- now to Green Tree. We had over XXXX showings and a series of price reductions before we finally secured a buyer. With a sales price of {$420000.00} it would pay in full our balance on the 1st and pay approx. {$9500.00} on the {$72000.00} HELOC balance. 
Green Tree refused to release the lien unless we came up with an additional {$5000.00} ( which I took out a XXXX loan ). They refused to release my husband for the liability. We were forced to submit tax returns and all asset statements. Our only assets are in our retirement accounts. Our credit scores are high as we have been diligent about trying to reduce debt to prepare for retirement. We are half-way through with putting our XXXX daughter through college and money continues to be tight. The charge off from XXXX dropped off my husband 's credit report in XXXX XXXX and there was never any Green Tree account listed. We closed escrow on the sale of our home XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
Beginning in XXXX XXXX the phone calls started. Three and four times a day to my husband 's office, cell, my cell and office. I explained to them that we had nothing else to pay them and we are close to retirement age ( XXXX and XXXX ). Our only assets are in our retirement accounts. We sent ( registered mail ) two separate do not call letters. I also explained that I was not on the note -- only my husband was. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX we received a letter ( forwarded from our old address ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Cover letter was from Green Tree Servicing dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that "" Our records indicate this loan has been settled in full to Green Tree Servicing LLC. 
Attached was the original HELOC Revolving Loan Agreement -- only in my husband 's name and only his signature. 
Today ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) I checked our credit reports and was stunned to find a new entry on both our reports ( XXXX XXXX only ) listing past due {$58000.00} Charged Off as Bad Debt and Profit and Loss Write Off. 
Green Tree purchased this note for XXXX from XXXX, they received a 20 % pay day on their investment. We ca n't pay them any more and I need assistance in getting this handled once and for all. We do n't want to be forced into bankruptcy over this debt. I need assistance in removing this from our credit reports and ending this issue once and for all.

2/12/2016,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"XX/XX/XXXX, I experienced a loss of employment and was forced to put my home on the market, as I could no longer afford it. I ended up having to do a short sale on the home, and it was approved by my mortgage companies. My XXXX mortgage was completely resolved with the proceeds from the sale. However, soon after, I was notified by PNC Bank that my home equity line of credit was not completely resolved. They told me that a balance was still owed. I immediately resumed payments on this account, and have made consistent, monthly payments on this account for well over three years now. It recently came to my attention that PNC Bank is reporting this account as a collection account! Despite three and a half years of loyal, timely payments, they are reporting this account as a collection account. Additionally, I have discovered that they are re-setting my date of last activity every time I make a payment. So instead of reporting the date of last activity as the date they put the account in collections, they continue to re-set that date monthly. I can only assume that they are doing this to perpetuate the seven years they can continue to report this debt on my credit report. My credit is not perfect, but this situation is having a devastating effect on my overall credit rating. I have contacted PNC Bank about this situation on numerous occasions, but they offer no resolution. There were XXXX different avenues I could have taken about this matter when the short-sale occurred. I could have just let the account go, and stopped making payments. After all, I no longer lived in the house. However, I decided to do the honorable thing, and continue to make loyal payments to this debt. In my opinion, PNC Bank has literally punished me for doing the right thing.

My complaint is I have never received any correspondence from the Department of Revenue regarding any delinquent taxes for the years indicated in the demand letter sent by this law firm/collection agency. Moreover, I have paid my state income taxes for the years identified in their correspondence. This demand letter seems to be a fraudulent claim of debt or deceptive action to scare me into payment of a tax claim that I do not owe. The language in the demand letter utilizes legal verbaige to bully and coerce a person into paying monies they do not owe. This practice seems deceptive and an unfair way of doing business. As a senior citizen, I find theses correspondance abusive and alarming. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I sent a letter to Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson , LLP requesting as per the Fair Debt Collection Pracice Act, they forward all documentation to me to validate this claim. Instead of adhereing to the federal law, they sent me the XXXX XXXX letter demanding payment of {$30000.00} or else. They have not sent me any documentation to validate this claim. This action seems to be in direct conflict with the law or autocratic demeanor that they are above the law. 
If this firm is pursuing me like this, one can only assume they are doing this to many people in Illinois and/or throughout the country.

5/11/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"I Deposited my first paycheck from my new job at the nearest JP Morgan Chase Bank to my new residence a mere XXXX mile journey requiring a round trip on the ferry, usually 5 hours travel. Less then a week later Chase bank blocked and started closing my account. They told me issues with the signatures on that check. 
I 've been a customer with JP Morgan Chase off and on for more then a decade. This response and escalation was very rapid, unusual, and unnecessary. I was directed to speak to the fraud department and was left feeling punished, sincerely asking myself, "" What did I do wrong? How is this my fault? '' Eventually I 'm told that JP Morgan Chase will be holding my money hostage, I 'm paraphrasing, until I bring my employer to a chase bank branch. From our neighborhood, where my employer and I both reside, its a 5-8 hour trip, depending on traffic and ferry to visit a branch. My employer is being asked to loose XXXX dollars in production to close shop for a day, loose sleep to catch a ferry, pay for ferry fees and gas on top of it. I understand his hesitation to accompany me and insistence that I find another way. 
My employer has looked into just stopping the check and reissuing me one, but his bank, XXXX XXXX, has already released the funds. 
Furthering my frustration, I also bank here locally on the XXXX at XXXX bank. I keep my same old Chase bank account so I can send money to my grandmother who also banks there, and because it was linked to a decade old insurance settlement which makes a large annual deposit. I would have deposited the paycheck locally if not for needing to get XXXX dollars to my grandmother ASAP. On my local account I noticed I was going to need money from the Chase account to cover a few checks I had written, the most important was to pay for court and probation on my suspended licence. I decided to bite the bullet and pay the fee for a wire transfer, it would be immediate rather then waiting the usual 2 days to transfer some money from Chase to XXXX. I left the chase account money for Grandma, some to cover what ever fees, and a little for a buffer, the rest was to go to XXXX. I scheduled it for the next day, the day my paycheck was projected to clear. That was the day Chase closed my account. As a result of the failed wire XXXX Checks I wrote bounced including the XXXX to court, I do n't know if I 'm violating probation or not and I 'm denied access to funds to fix it. My reputation with my local bank and a few small locally owned businesses is now tarnished as a result of Chase banks over reaction, and the bounced checks that resulted, as well as a few insufficient funds fees and a few returns on unfunded internet orders. 
Being associated with the frustration of this situation is causing my insecurity to manifest in a perception that my value as an employee is diminishing. This perception fills me with XXXX. Compounded with the legal issues, and the simple financial woes of the money that was going to pay for the next few months of expenses is not available, and I do n't know when they will be. Will it be before the electric bill comes in, or rent. The XXXX swelters and suffocates, its palpable, keeping me awake all night, effecting my productivity, further diminishing my perception of my value, increasing my XXXX.

5/8/2015,Debt collection,Auto,Disclosure verification of debt,Not given enough info to verify debt,"XXXX XXXX, XXXX I performed a periodic review of my credit report through a service that Transunion offers and discovered that a summary judgment had been filed against me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX in the amount of {$18000.00} in XXXX XXXX XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX # : XXXX XXXX for an outstanding debt on an auto lease owed to BMW Financial Services. 

I had a 36 month lease with BMW Financial Services with a beginning balance of {$27000.00} that commenced in XXXX XXXX. Monthly payments were {$770.00}. My last payment on the vehicle was XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX it was repossessed. I spoke to XXXX XXXX at the time and was told they did not plan to pursue the remaining balance as the car had sold almost immediately and was well under the mileage requirement. This might be unusual, but I had no reason to believe anything else was the case as I 've heard nothing further from either XXXX or any third party collection agency until I saw the judgment appear in my credit report. 

I immediately retained counsel referred to me by the VA XXXX XXXX and my attorney discovered that notice had been posted on the door of an apartment I have not lived in since XXXX XXXX. It is n't even the last address of record with XXXX. 

The summary judgment was dismissed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Opposing counsel ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) for XXXX XXXX XXXX had until XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide some evidence of the debt. The deadline passed with no evidence given. My attorney XXXX XXXX spoke to XXXX and was told they no longer planned to pursue because of their lack of evidence and a nonsuit would be filed. 

On several occasions opposing counsel had not appeared for during scheduled court appearances and the judge had given a continuance. Because of this we went to court yesterday to request that the case be dismissed with prejudice due to the lack of evidence. The opposing counsel did appear and stated at this time that a nonsuit had been filed. 

I 've spent nearly {$2000.00} in attorney fees, not only has my credit been affected for the last year, but because I 'm a registered representative working for a broker/dealer, I 'm required to disclose the judgment to the agency XXXX which then has that information as public for anyone to access when they run XXXX 's broker check on me. To this day I have never ONCE seen a solitary piece of paper from XXXX XXXX XXXX notifying me of their intention to collect on a debt ... ..nor did they provide a single document when requested to do so in court. Not XXXX. 

Surely there is some recourse that consumers have when such frivolous lawsuits are filed with no substance whatsoever and with the intent to collect on a debt that they have no evidence exists? The ability to file a last minute "" nonsuit '' seems to have prevented them from having to admit this in front of a judge, but it has also left the door open for them to pursue the issue XXXX more time. At a minimum, they should be responsible for the attorney fees I 've incurred. I 'm surprised that this is even legal. 

I have any and all documentation supporting everything outlined above if requested. I 've never filed a complaint to any agency anywhere. But this group could have garnished my wages and caused horrific damage to my ability to support myself and my daughter while having nothing to prove any debt was owed at all. I find it suspicious that I was notified of the original court date with a notice on my door for an address they would have known was n't accurate if they did receive their information from BMW Financial. As mentioned previously that 's not the address of record with BMW as can be seen from my account statements.

HR contacted me and passed this initial interview. I was then passed on to the HR trainer where 4 weeks of training would be conducted on line. XXXX 2 weeks I was learning policies, acronyms, processes, etc. and passing weekly tests. The XXXX week i was asked to purchased some equipment ( valued at {$7400.00} XXXX and send out of country to a new office being opened. Being careful throughout this whole process about identity theft, I provided no personal info, in fact the hiring company said a few times that no personal info was required untill I passed the 4 weeks of training and met the hiring manager for the final interview. So for the XXXX project I was issued XXXX that had an account # and routing # XXXX CHASE BANK XXXX with funds that were put into my name that were to be used to purchase the equipment. I was asked to use my personal CC at this time till I became full time employed. I transfered the funds from the account info provided into my personal CC and waited till the funds posted. Once posted a few days later I proceeded to purchase the requested equipment and ship out of country to the designated address. I was requested to use USPS priority international delivery. I was then asked to perform the exact same task a second time which is when I suspected something was n't right and asked a few more questions. At this time the response from XXXX XXXX was not acceptable and knew at this time something was wrong. I sent a final email declining the XXXX project / /purchase and also declined any employement with the company., I then proceeded to stop the shipment that was done earlier that morning with the USPS and was told that I was not able to stop it being it is an international shipment. I then contacted my credit card company "" CHASE '' and explained the situation and was told the funds are OK and no issues. I have been checking my account daily to ensure no issues and on XXXX/XXXX/15, the posted amount of {$8000.00} was reversed from my credit card account. I do not understand how CHASE bank that the funds were transfered from did not know the account I was using to transfer funds does not have a check / balance process in place to review and detect scams like this. A phone call or text or something to the actual owner of the account. Besides the names being different on the accounts. Todays day and age with technology, banks should be able to detect scams like this.

6/4/2015,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account terms,"Please note there is an additional complaint for XXXX and XXXX, with the same issue - This Complaint is regarding the falsified filings to CRA by debt collection agencies, and specifically - XXXX. I had a credit card that was opened with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and subsequently went to default, and was purchased by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX and I, went to court to resolve the actual amount due - I won the dispute, with a final balance being due as XXXX. The initial debt they stated was XXXX, plus interest. XXXX reported this debt to all XXXX CRA 's starting in XXXX. 
Because this impacted my Credit Score in such a harmful manner, I did not attempt to apply for any credit until XXXX, when I felt the impact had subsided enough. When I would get a rejection notice, for credit cards, auto refinance etc - I assumed that the statement "" Major Delinquency on your report '' meant the fact that I had a then XXXX year old, paid collection on my report. 
I ordered copies of my credit report over the past few months, and in all XXXX CRA 's, there was a Payment history - for a collection account. Because I know that this is impossible, I sent disputes repeatedly to all CRA 's, asking that they verify my accounts with XXXX and then XXXX. The last verification actually wiped out the history - and instead inserted a "" C '' ( Collection Flag ) in XXXX of XXXX. 
That prompted me to really look at what this account was doing - The account is an account with a Debt Collector, not a credit grantor yet -- - XXXX inserted this record into my Credit Reports as if they were a credit grantor. This has been on my file for 4 years now, with falsified dates and account data. 
XXXX. XXXX Collection Account on TransUnion, is listed as an OPEN non revolving/installment, depending on how its viewed. It is NOT under any collections section, or as a type XXXX. Is not visible under the collection accountsb. Shows in the negative section - because of the Collection Pay StatusXXXX. Has NO date closed Dated. Is Reporting as a Credit Account - not a collection accounte. Reports itself as an OPEN TYPE Line of Credit ( purposed for XXXX - Utilities, etc ) of which this account is notXXXX. Uses the Date Opened date of their debt purchase, to make this account appear more currentg. Uses the XXXX Delinquency Date, to store the debt purchase Date, to make this account appear more currenth. Uses Creditor Classification - of Factoring, even though they are a debt collector. 
i. Because of the way this is reporting, it appears as though I have : i. An Open : Non Revolving, Retail Credit Line with XXXXii. That has been in Collections since XX/XX/XXXXiii. I did not Pay in Full, when court documents in fact say I didiv. All while they can not legally extend any form of credit, or - Report themselves as doing so. 
v. This XXXX Account, is causing me to be rejected for credit, and numerous other problems including being forced to pay higher fees, and rates when dealing with credit grantors. 
vi. I have NO Other Collection AccountsI honestly believe the CRA 's are aware of Debt Collection Agencies masquerading as Credit Grantors, as the files that are submitted to them, do little to verify or weed out such activity. Collection.Org, a software application used by many collectors - allows DCA 's to simply select a check box- and self identify as a Credit Grantor, thus allowing these DCA 's to insert data to massage collectoiion account into becoming retail accounts and in the attempt to have the most impact possible on a consumers score. 
This agency should not only look at my complaint - but the files of consumers who bring you complains about debt collectors, as I believe that this is not only common practice - but, accepted by the CRA 's as it has never been expected that anyone would actually know.

The charge came from a merchant whose services are pushed on me through mail marketing by the credit card company. I called the merchant and did get the charge reimbursed. I also called the credit card company and voiced my concern regarding a charge that was unauthorized and came from a merchant that is frequently marketed on me by them ( being the credit card company ). The credit card company offered to block the merchant and look into any wrong doing on the merchant side. The service associate told me that the credit card company did own the merchant company at one time. I now have the credit card company reviewing any wrong doing by the merchant. My question is, who will check on the credit card company for any wrong doing? Normally, I would not be that concerned about a charge dispute, but in this case, I am very concerned that the credit card company is not treating my information in a secure manner. I have had no dealings with the merchant ( that I can remember ) but yet they were still able to acquire my credit card information to charge it. I would like the credit card company to answer the question of, how did the merchant get me "" secure '' credit card information?

Being that I had never had a credit card before and it had a low limit I thought I was doing okay. They kept raising the limit and the interest which raised the note each month I had to pay before I realized it and they knew on my account notes that I was on a fixed income. so I tried to do what I could. It finally got to be too much and I could n't pay on it any longer. They started with harassing calls, threats with a collection agency until finally I got the police involved. Now it is past the seven years that the FCRA says they can legally keep it on my credit, yet Capital One keeps it on there like a dog with a bone because they do n't want me to ever have a chance to start over. They want me to stay in the ditch forever. The whole point of the seven year rule was that you get to start over at some point. Not let it keep hanging like a noose around your neck forever. They also have an account of mine when I used to have a checking account which they activated some kind of auto debit which I did n't even know about and it overdrew my checking account by XXXX bucks. They did that thinking with my medical XXXX check going in automatically they would make money off of me. However, I was a little too quick for them. And so was social security. They were able to aid me in getting away from Capital One 's predatory tactics once and for all. They nor I however dreamed Capital One would chase me until my grave.

12/3/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My loan was just transfered to Carrington Mortgage Services. I 've had several home loans and this has been by far the most difficult one to work with. I pay extra on my mortgage every month. However, they make it very difficult for you to do so. I can not pay extra via their website. It shows the options to do so, but they do n't work. The most I can pay is my mortgage payment. My options are to call in and give a stranger my checking account info every month. Which they entered wrong the first month and did n't work anyway. Regardless, very time consuming to pay a single bill every month. I also, can make multiple payments to accomplish this. Since I ca n't make a larger payment, I have to make multiple payments. However, I can only make one per day via their website. It becomes a multi day hassle. Even so, I still will have to call to make sure the extra money under the other option is still added to the correct place. They also told me, I could pay extra provided I pay on or after the first every month via the website. That was a lie. Still does n't work. I 've never encountered a place to difficult to pay a bill. I 've had several car and home loans and by far the most difficult one to work with. They make it very hard for you to pay extra potentially trying to make sure your loan is dragged out as long as possible, making them more money and costing the consumer more. They need to make their website be able to take larger payments. Telling me that they 've had lots of complaints and "" that 's just how it is '' is unacceptable. If they ca n't fix it, I would request my mortgage be sold to another company. No other mortgage service I 've dealt with has been this difficult to work with. I should not have to spend this much time and effort to pay a single bill every month. It is n't fair to me, especially when I pay on time or early every month. It should n't be a punishment for that and wanting to pay extra to pay off my loan.

9/11/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"The wire-transfer to XXXX contemplated a credit by XXXX to a specific type deposit account for a specified amount of time, which was stated in the form of written payment instructions. The instructions stated, : "" This is a transfer to a secure time-deposit account for a minimum of 90-days. A notice will be sent to withdraw or extend for and additional 90-days ''. 
There are several different types of deposits and deposit accounts at XXXX. XXXX type deposit is a demand-deposit, which is a bank deposit the depositor may withdraw at any time without prior notice to the bank. This type deposit is made to a checking account, which is a demand-deposit account. The other type-deposit is a time deposit, which is a bank deposit that is to remain with the bank for a specified period or on which notice must be given to the bank before withdrawal and is in total contrast to a demand-deposit or a demand-deposit account like my checking account at XXXX. So, there 's at least XXXX totally different types of deposits and different types of deposit accounts at XXXX, and XXXX definitely knows all of these facts. 
The written payment instructions instructed XXXX to credit the funds specifically to a time-deposit account for a minimum 90-day period. The special written payment instructions provided XXXX with legal notice, legal notification and thus, definite legal cognizance of the fact that the funds were to be credited by XXXX specifically and only to a time-deposit account for a specified period of 90-days, and of the fact the funds were sent to specifically make a time-deposit. XXXX received notice in writing of the specific type-deposit and type-deposit account to which XXXX was to credit the funds. 
XXXX failed to exercise good faith or ordinary care concerning its crediting of the funds. XXXX definitely made a mistake when it credited the funds to the wrong type-deposit account and the wrong type deposit account beneficiary, in contravention of the written payment instructions on the payment order it received. As I see it, the funds were sent to a nonexistent and unidentifiable account and beneficiary. XXXX 's mistakes are the sole cause of the end result of the funds credited to my checking account at XXXX. It is impossible for this to happen without XXXX 's mistakes. 
I think that I should be able to justifiably expect XXXX and every bank to have commercially reasonable internal procedures designed to process a written transfer request in strict accordance with the depositor 's written instructions, to verify the accuracy of, and compliance with, written instructions, to detect and minimize inaccuracy, and to act diligently to remedy mistakes. 
My desired resolution to this matter is for XXXX to admit the fact, in writing to me on it 's letterhead from XXXX its ' officers, that XXXX made a mistake in its ' crediting of the funds to the wrong type-deposit account when XXXX credited the funds to my checking account and not to a XXXX time-deposit account as instructed. I believed XXXX owed a duty of care in its handling the payment order and it 's crediting of the funds to the proper type deposit account. XXXX made mistakes in this transaction and I want XXXX to say it in writing to me. I want XXXX to apologize to me in it 's letter for it 's mistakes. XXXX, also should say that but for it 's mistakes, the funds would not have ended up in my checking account. 
Lastly, the relationship between XXXX and me, whether derived from common-law principles or premises upon Article XXXX or Article XXXX to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, is in the nature of an implied contract. As a result of the contract, XXXX owed a duty to exercise good faith and ordinary care concerning the crediting of the funds to the proper type-deposit account, If it could not, then it should not have accepted the payment order and the funds.

My payment history in the last 12 months ( Attachment XXXX ) shows that I have been paying at least this amount every quarter. 
I have not received any written or verbal notification of change in my quarterly amount {$560.00} or my interest rate. I was not aware that a late fee would be assessed or was assessed since this was not reflected on XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2016 when I made full payment. 
This incorrect record on my credit report has caused severe damage to my financial life, and I would like to request the credit bureau to immediately DELETE this record as it is false.

I never did it, because when I arrived to XXXX XXXX Michigan and discovered they did lie to me, I asked to cancel the contract and they did it by word. The manager told me that they were so sorry and that they understood that they were not that close to the university. 

Everything went well, they have my email address. 
They never contacted me again. On XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from ProCollect with a debt of XXXX dls. 

I do not recognize this debt because I never lived in XXXX XXXX, and I never signed a contract in person in their office. 

Now this is affecting my credit score. I have't had any problems with my credit scores before, I always pay my debts when I know I owe money but they never tried to contact me during this 2 years and now they are just affecting me. 

The manager at that time told me that I was fine. I do not have any other documents from them telling me that I owe money. 

So I do not recognize this debt, since the manager canceled it.

11/19/2015,Credit card,,Payoff process,,"I purchased a {$1100.00} washing machine in XXXX 2015 on my Sears Mastercard with no interest, deferred billing for 12 months. In XXXX, 2015 I did a balance transfer to the same XXXX for {$4300.00} using their Convenience Check sent in the mail. In XXXX 2015, I purchased for my mother a {$1500.00} refrigerator using the same XXXX. Of the XXXX options at the time of purchasing the refrigerator, I opted for a 5 % discount on the price by using my credit card. The other XXXX options were deferred billing or free delivery. I had created a budget to pay off these charges within the time frame and have been making steady payments. Knowing that I was going to pay off the refrigerator in full when the statement came, I noticed that on my other charges Sears has been allocating like 98 % of my monthly payments to the large balance transfer ( which cost me an upfront fee of {$140.00}, and it IS NOT accruing interest like the washing machine is ). Upset by this and more importantly, I was worried that the refrigerator ( as a current charge ) would not be paid in full, even though I was paying it in full, I called Sears. I found out today exactly what I had feared. I had paid {$1800.00} this month of which Sears DID NOT allocate the full {$1500.00} to my refrigerator and now I have an interest charge on it! They paid around $ 1100+ and the rest of my payment went to the balance transfer, not even the washing machine which has {$170.00} of deferred interest. The Manager in North Carolina would not help me. I was given a bunch of rhetoric. I was told that if I had managed my account better this would not be the situation. They love to say "" there is a hierarchy payment structure. '' I was told her hands were tied. So, I told her that I was filling out this complaint as we spoke. She said, "" You got to do what you have to do. '' I told her I am and that you guys would be my muscle. She called me back in about XXXX minutes and left a message that they would pay the refrigerator in full. But, a bigger problem still persists. What started out as a 12-months, same as cash offer to pay off the washing machine has now been squeezed into a 5-month same as cash to pay the remaining balance of {$1100.00}. It 's been 7 months since I have been making payments and that balance has gone down by only {$15.00}! This is criminal. I now have 5 months to pay off {$1100.00}. I am so upset and feel so abused by the banking system. Please help me. I do n't know how I 'm going to get that {$1100.00} paid in full by XXXX to prevent the {$170.00} in interest. I still have a balance due on the balance transfer. No matter what I pay, they refuse to allocate any money toward the washing machine. My reality is that I have to pay around {$3200.00} by XXXX to avoid paying {$170.00} in interest. You have done a tremendous job in credit-card reform with how statements read concerning revolving debt and payments. This is the next major assault that you have to blow the lid off. I am desperate.

In XXXX of 2015 I contacted JC Penney/Synchrony Bank in order to rectify and pay off any past due debt that I owed them. I came to an agreement with them and even received a letter stating that they would accept a settlement offer of {$360.00} dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 in order to close out the account. I happily accepted and as soon as I got the letter I attempted to consumate the agreement and pay them off. When I tried calling them to pay off the amount agreed upon, I was told by a XXXX that they could n't accept my payment because they were no longer collecting the debt because it was past the "" statute of limitations. '' When I asked her to clarify that statement, she could n't clarify it but just said that they would not be taking my money. I asked for an employee ID and she refused. I then asked to speak to a manager and was transferred to a voicemail. I attempted to call him again at a later date and XXXX again I got a voicemail and have yet to receive a return call. I then spoke to a different representative named XXXX on a different date and he said they would not take my money. They even sent me a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 which is just 6 days after they sent me a settlement offer stating that they were not going to collect on this debt but that they were still going to credit report it! For a few weeks I tried calling them to pay them the settlement offer we had agreed upon but they still wo n't accept my payment. I may not be a legal expert, but I know they ca n't simply refuse my payment because they are claiming they are no longer collecting it and STILL report it as an unpaid debt. That is fraud, defamation of character, and outright Malicious. Not only that, but because they wo n't take my money to clear this debt I am unable to proceed in obtaining credit as most creditors want me to pay this debt before they will extend me credit themselves. Does Synchrony Bank want their money or not? Either they accept my money so I can clear off my debt or they truly stop collecting this debt and stop reporting any balance owed since they refuse to accept any payments. They ca n't have it both ways. Please assist me in this as I am trying very hard to clear up my debt and if you can not assist me then I will be forced to sue Synchrony Bank.

3/30/2016,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"I signed a loan at a very young age about 9 years ago and have struggled since in paying the amount due ever since. I have fallen behind on several occasions because of not being able to maintain the minimal standard of living for myself and dependent. The interest rate is set at 12 %. I started my loan by borrowing {$20000.00} and 9 years later I am at {$29000.00} due to interest. I continue to struggle and can not provide what I need to for myself and son with this extremely high payment of {$460.00} a month as well as it will end up being {$100000.00} of repayment by the end of the "" life of the loan ''. The private loan company does nothing to help me make this easier ( by lowering the interest rate/payment ). I have been without a place of my own since I was divorced in 2013 and I am forced to stay with family and or my boyfriend. I can not contribute financially to the household because of this and I am at the end of "" favors '' being given by people as we ( myself and my child ) are causing financial strain on others now. Without lowering my payment/interest rate so I can have an affordable payment I will not be able to have a home of our own until the loan is paid off. I have exhausted the forbearance offered years ago and the loan company says I am not in "" undue hardship '' because I have {$400.00} a month left over after they calculated my bills. This does NOT include rent/utilities that I NEED to pay but are NOT paying yet because I have to "" mooch/live for free '' off of my family and boyfriend. I work for "" public service '' and because this is a private loan I am offered XXXX relief. I have another 9 years left on the loan and with that being said my current financial situation is likely to continue for a significant part of the repayment period. I need help ... the only other step I may take is to file chapter XXXX or XXXX bankruptcy. This is insane to start with a {$20000.00} loan that has spiked up to a {$29000.00} loan that will inevitably be paid back in the amount of {$100000.00} ... no one should be forced to live in poverty because of such high interest rates nonadjustable.

The bank indicated too much time has lapsed when I reported this issue in a timely manner. 
As a consequence, the merchant had every excuse not to return the Mattress. 
A Banking representative even contacted XXXX XXXX and everyone at the store indicated that he or she can not speak English. However, on the contrary ; the furniture store ; in particular wrote in English and XXXX who answered the phone wrote the order. 
Recently as of yesterday ; the bank stated that my charges could not be reversed due to a time-lapse. I wrote all my statements and provided information in a timely manner to Bank Of America. Bank of America has insurance for such claims. Bank of America reversed the charges from my checking account in the amount of {$580.00}. 
This has been going on for seven months, and this claim should have been resolved. 
The Merchant even indicated to the Bank that I am enjoying the mattress ; which I never used and welcome the opportunity even today for XXXX XXXX to pick up the Mattress. 
I contacted the Merchant immediately after receipt of this Mattress, and the merchant was very uncooperative, and I could not even speak to a representative which is unethical business practice and fraud.

7/31/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"This is the XXXX time I am complaining to you about the unfair banking practices of Wells Fargo in relation to their checking accounts. I accessed my bank account online and Wells Fargo showed a posted balance of {$190.00}. The asterisk clearly states the posted balance includes transactions that are pending, thus leading the customer to believe the posted balance is the remaining balance minus the pending transactions. So, over the weekend I purchased XXXX product for {$12.00} and then another product for {$5.00}, which are new transactions totaling {$17.00}. The new transactions totaling {$17.00} should well be covered by the posted balance of {$190.00}, right? No, I was charged XXXX XXXX overdraft fees for a total of {$100.00} to cover the {$12.00}, {$5.00} and another recurring {$4.00} transaction. The posted balance is a false balance and leads the consumer to think he or she has more money in the account than he or she actually does, So what happens? The consumer purchases something within the posted balance and creates overdrafts on multiple items, which is profit for the bank. ( I do n't think it costs the bank {$35.00} to "" cover '' a {$12.00} or {$5.00} purchase ) Either the bank 's assertion that the posted balance includes posted AND pending transactions is purposely misleading or the posted balances are miscalculated. In either scenario, the consumer is primed for overdraft fees. This practice must stop and I am asking your Bureau to investigate and ensure personal checking balances are accurate within the industry. Personally, I believe I should not have paid overdraft fees since I acted on the posted balance as stated by Wells Fargo and I am seeking reimbursement.

First, my home was hit by a hurricane in 2004, and Chase held up insurance payments to me during rehab of the property, causing me to pay subs out of pocket, and waiting for months to be reimbursed. I know that was not the intent of the law that sends insurance payments to the lien holder. They only have one department that handles these disasters, and they are located in California, with no concept of hurricanes. 
Now, every year for the last five years, I get a threatening letter with regards to flood insurance. I pay the flood insurance, and have for the last 25 years, on the due date. Their corporate policy automatically sends the threatening letter out if they have not received the renewal by the due date. There is a reason it is called a due date, it is not due before then. Their policy places a unfair burden on the consumer, even though the consumer is in compliance. In discussing the issue with them, I was informed to pay the flood insurance before it is due. I have done that in the past, and I still get the letter, so I assume it is harassment because I would not refinance with them. The reason I will not refinance with them is because of these corporate policies. I 'm looking to refinance with local credit unions so I can get good customer service instead of harassment.

4/30/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"I am wondering if you can assist me with filing a formal complaint regarding the servicer of my current XXXX loan that is serviced through Seneca Mortgage Servicing. 
I have been actively trying to get them to provide me with their Assumption requirements for my loan since XXXX/XXXX/15. They originally refused to acknowledge my loan is eligible for an Assumption, even though all of my origination documentation states it is eligible for an assumption. They then had stated they do not have an actual assumption process in place to support eligibility requirements that my mortgage qualifies for. Not having an assumption process in place as a servicer is also not aligned to FHFA servicing requirements, or those outlined under the CFPB requirements. They advised since they do not have a formal process, my only option is to refinance my loan, which is unfair, and deceptive practices in my opinion. They want to push my into a refi process to potentially charge me additional points, fees etc, which I am not the least interested in and have advised them accordingly a few times. They then sent me a letter for loss mitigation options, which I am also not interested in what so ever, as I am current, have always been current, and I do not have a financial hardship. As I have tried escalating this issues as a formal complaint with them, they also do not have a complaint process in place, no acknowledgement of my complaint, and no follow up with me on the issue. I am not sure if they as a smaller servicer, are also held to the same standards to manage a complaint process as set forth with requirements under the O.C.C., National Servicing Standards, CFPB requirements or by FHFA. The only time they respond to me is if I initiate another email to them online. I have let them know they had until last Friday, XXXX to contact me with an acceptable solution based on what my loan is eligible for based on my origination documents, which is well over 30 days from when I contacted them, followed up XXXX different times to work through the issue. I advised if they have not contacted me, like they have not been, my only other option is to escalate this issue to FHFA, you FHLMC, the CFPB, the O.C.C. and my state AG. They have not upheld requirements for all of these agencies to support an assumption process, have used unfair/deceptive practices to push me to products I do n't want/need, all due to their inability to service my loans to the eligibility/standards outlined in my origination documents I signed. 
Anything you can do to assist is appreciated. This is also all also documented in their online email site as well.

6/12/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"My husband passed away in XXXX of 2013. A couple months before he passed away, during XXXX, I had to file bankruptcy as we 'd lost his income for over a year. Prior to the bankruptcy, we had never missed any payments and our credit was outstanding. OCWEN Mortgage carried our home loan. After my husband passed away, I received proceeds from XXXX insurance policies. I tried for months and months and months to talk with someone at OCWEN to look at various options to reduce my payment so I could stay in the home. It was literally a merry-go-round. Then I received a letter introducing my new customer care person who was dedicated to personally assisting me in finding ways to work together. They would have me set an appointment when THEY called me. I was running a XXXX a month negative which I was pulling from life insurance proceeds. I offered OCWEN {$150000.00} ( my loan amount was {$320000.00} ) to restructure or refinance my loan to reduce the payment so I could afford to stay in the house. Because it was in bankruptcy status, they said they could not refinance or do anything to help or work with me. I sold my home and moved on with my life. I have never in my life talked to so many people within one company and received such a runaround. I later learned from an attorney, one of my XXXX, OCWEN was being sued in a class-action suit by a group of realtors. I was SO HAPPY and hoped those people got every penny from OCWEN. They were horrible to work with. He told me about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Also after I just finished an article in Consumer Reports, I decided to try and get this out to the public so others hopefully will never have to go through what I went through. Be aware there are home mortgages loans offered under other names that actually are OCWEN. PLEASE be aware.

They pressured me to promise to pay more than I could afford and I told them this, but they continued to use high -pressure tactics to make me agree with them which I would end up doing in order to get off the phone. XXXX agent even starting yelling to her co-workers "" she 's lying, she is not going to pay '' while using these colelction techniques. 

Then they would call me every day afrerwords even though we had come to an agreement and we would have the same pressure conversations causing me emotional stress. If I did not answer my cell phone they would repeatedly call my job, EVEN AFTER I SPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM I HAD GOTTEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE HEAD OF SECURITY, and they would make the receptionist give me a hand written note. 

In addition to this, they repeatedly called my boss and left him messages regarding the debt and he spoke to me about it as they were bothering him at work as well. This caused a strain on my work environment and additional stress to me personally. 

They also called my mom repeatedly as well as my long-time friend regarding the debt. 

The interest rates they charge and the amounts they loan put you in a cycle where you are unable to pay them back, and they will not allow you to make reasonable payments. I am responsible for agreeing to the "" quick money loan '', but was not prepared for the horrible experience that i was getting myself into. Check City, however, is perfectly aware what they do to people who are facing having their water shut or electricity shut off with a child in the house and not only do they prey upon them, they proceed to harass and belittle them and make sure your job, family, and friends are aware of your personal financial situation as well. 

Shame on them. Perhaps if they would lower their interest rates to 100 % instead of 400 % - 500 % they would get paid back more often and still make XXXX times the interest a credit card company makes.

The day after they responded to my complaint- instead of deleting it, they actually updated the collection on my XXXX credit report. Commonwealth also responded to the XXXX stating they were removing the collection. I contacted XXXX fraud department and they assured me that they had placed a fraud alert on my credit report and that they would begin their own investigation. With the enormous number of complaints against Commonwealth Financial Systems I am baffled as to why the CFPB has not taken action against them. I feel like this nightmare is never going to end.
